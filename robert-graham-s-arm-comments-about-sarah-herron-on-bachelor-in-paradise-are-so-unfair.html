She was pretty excited to finally get some attention paid to her by someone who wasn't <a href=# class=T3D>a reality TV disaster (I'm looking at you Chris Bukowski.)</a> Especially when Robert picked her over Michelle Money, which meant a lot to Sarah to be someone's first choice.</p><p>Sarah and Robert's date was pretty standard Bachelor fare: a day sailing on a fancy yacht complete with the two of them standing on the bow shouting, "I'm king of the world!" in an homage to <i>Titanic</i>. Everything was romantic and perfect. Unfortunately for viewers saw a side to Robert that was a little unfortunate. In a confessional he called attention to Sarah's arm (which she's been missing since birth) and made a statement that basically said how brave she was to come to <i>Paradise</i> and look for love despite it all.</p><p>I mean, yeah, Sarah is brave to come back to the craziness that is a <i>Bachelor</i> show, but for Robert to insinuate that for some reason finding love in her "condition" is too tough and she's so brave to come anyway feels a little weird. She's way more than just her number of limbs.</p><p>On Sean Lowe's season, Sarah never let her arm slow her down, and went on the show's first active group date where she repelled down a freaking building. Later that season she even gave the roller derby group date a shot. She fell a lot, but she got right back up and tried again.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>I'm sure that Robert was prompted to comment on her arm by a producer, but that's still kind of gross. Like, can we have a show that doesn't try to make her all about the way she was born? Sarah is a beautiful, smart, personable woman and she's not that <i>despite</i> her arm, like Robert implied. She is the way she is and we should all just accept that.</p><p>Starting with the <i>Bachelor</i> cast and crew, let's view Sarah as a normal person, instead of a person with one arm. That would be great.</p><p><i>Images: ABC (2)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx0g5JsZ2aqn5eys8CMoKmaoJGiwG6t0aZknKedorKvwNJmmJunpal6tK3Rmp9moJWnv7C6jKilZpqRmLWmuM6rZKKmXaWus63DoqqeZZGnsm6%2Fzmasp56Rnr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-alex-curry-s-husband-a-closer-look-at-their-love-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Alex Currys Husband?
