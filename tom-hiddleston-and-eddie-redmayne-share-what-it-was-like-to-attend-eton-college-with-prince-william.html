Some of the most notable Eton alumni include <a href=#>Prince William</a>, Oscar-Award winner Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston.</p><p id=par-2_56>Redmayne and the Duke of Cornwall attended Eton College together and were friends during their time at the school. Like many who have had a first-hand encounter with members of the <a href=#>royal family</a>, Redmayne had a lot to say about his time at Eton with the prince, who is now first in line to the throne.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eton-college-is-the-most-distinguished-boys-school-in-the-world>Eton College is the most distinguished boys school in the world</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_46>Formerly known as just Eton, <a href=#>Eton College</a> is a public all-boys boarding school located in Berkshire, England. The school was founded by King Henry VI in the 14th century and only admitted 70 qualified students (known as King’s Scholars) via a scholarship funded by the king.</p><p id=par-4_59>While the school expanded to accommodate over 1200 students, the founding tradition continued with the naming of 14 King’s Scholars each year, which totals to 70 students according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britannica</a>. The rest of the students, known as Oppidans, have for centuries come from England’s elite, retaining the Eton’s reputation as the most prestigious school in the whole of Europe.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_54>Former Eton alumni have gone on to achieve great success in politics, business, and others have become Hollywood household names. Most notable former Eton students include Prince William and his brother <a href=#>Harry the Duke of Sussex</a>, Billions star Damian Lewis, actor and producer Dominic West, Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne to name a few.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eddie-redmayne-felt-sorry-for-prince-william-during-their-time-at-eton>Eddie Redmayne felt sorry for Prince William during their time at Eton</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_61>Eddie Redmayne attended Eton College at the same time as Prince William, and the pair were both part of The Eton Society and played for the school rugby team together. Speaking of his time with the prince at Eton, Redmayne revealed that <a href=#>he often felt sorry for the prince</a> because he took all the hits when they were playing rugby together.</p><p id=par-7_79>&nbsp;“I always felt a bit sorry for him because basically any school you played, all they wanted to do was tackle Prince William, and they could say, I tackled Prince William,” said the Fantastic Beasts star. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hola</a>, Redmayne and the future King lost touch after school, as they went on to pursue different interests in different colleges. Even so, he still recounts the former Prince of Wales as being a lovely man from their time at Eton.</p><p id=par-8_64>Even though he was the target of attacks at the rugby field, <a href=#>Prince William was a popular student at Eton</a> who seemed to <a href=#>fit in better than his brother Harry</a>.&nbsp; The crown prince thrived at Eton, especially since it’s a boarding school, which gave him the opportunity to <a href=#>get away from the problems at home and his mother’s emotional issues</a> following his parents’ separation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-hiddleston-had-a-very-rough-time-at-eton>Tom Hiddleston had a very rough time at Eton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TomHiddleston-e1671565135673.jpg><p id=par-9_44>For a pillar of prestige, it seems that Eton College was not all that kind to all students. And much like most high schools around the world, some of the students were bullied, and more surprising is that Tom Hiddleston was one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_119>The Golden Globe Award winner revealed at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Graham Norton Show</a> that he was picked on at school for his peculiar last name. They dubbed him Piddle and made a rhyme in mockery in Hiddleston, “Hiddle Piddle did a widdle in the middle of the night” which was quite embarrassing.</p><p>Hiddleston, who also attended Eton in Prince William’s time, spoke well of the royal. Although the pair were not particularly close friends at school, they would sometimes talk in passing. Speaking of their friendship, The Avengers star said, “I Think Prince William is very busy today, and he has more important things to do than to hang out with me! But sometimes I see him at film premieres, it’s nice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBsLmMoaCdnJyawLW7zWacnZyZmnqzscOmmLKmlWK9s7XNnJxmr5mhuaqtzGacraeeYrCwuMuenp5mmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./you-are-about-to-be-jeff-bezos-level-bald-cosmetologist-gets-the-final-laugh-over-major-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>You are about to be Jeff Bezos level bald: Cosmetologist gets the final laugh over major hair</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hardcastle-wikipedia-bio-age-parents-and-net-worth-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hardcastle Wikipedia Bio Age Parents And Net Worth 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
