I stop breathing.”</p><p>According to Marie, the real reason it happened was because had she lost 30 lbs on a crash diet and was suffering from, a dangerously low potassium level.&nbsp; She is now calling DWTS, Dancing with the Starved.&nbsp; She says that the show leads to extreme dieting.&nbsp; She also went on to blast Jonathan and show host <strong>Tom Bergeron</strong> for not catching her. “Where was my partner and where was Tom?”</p><p>In the interview Marie continued with her rant and said women have it harder than men on the show.&nbsp; She said, “The boys do nothing, the girls do all the dancing!”&nbsp; She felt she got tough routines while the men have it easy.&nbsp; Her proof is the fact that her brother <strong>Donny Osmond</strong> won the mirror ball trophy in 2009 and she only got to the finals.&nbsp; She of course considers that she is the better dancer of the two.&nbsp; hmm sounds like sour grapes to me.</p><p>With ratings dropping producers of DWTS are outraged at Marie’s comments but she does not care.&nbsp; She felt like she was bullied on the show, “She knows other contestants have gotten terrible treatment by pro-dancers, judges and crew members.”&nbsp; She wants the world know the truth about Dancing with the Stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxnnZa%2FqrGMqKqmp56Zeqmt056qZpyRo7CqusZmrqKsmGLBqbGMrKuaqqNiwLWt0a%2BcnWWSqrmttcSdZLCdnpnGbsPIpaOimZ2oenJ8kWpm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mr-capone-e-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mr. Capone-E Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./klaas-jan-huntelaar-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Klaas-Jan Huntelaar Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
