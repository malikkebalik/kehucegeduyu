A couple’s onscreen chemistry often <a href=#>spills over to a real-life romance</a>.

Her character Elena Dawson was created as a new love interest for widowed billionaire Devon Hamilton (Bryton James). Elena and Devon’s amazing onscreen chemistry made them a fan favorite. As it turns out, an attraction was being for the actors.</p><p id=par-3_36>Sarpy and James began dating as <a href=#>Elena and Devon’s romance took off</a>. The couple wasn’t shy about sharing their love on social media. The two often posted photos from their vacations or hanging out with friends.</p><p id=par-4_41>However, like Elena and Devon, Sarpy and James’ relationship might be over. While neither hasn’t commented on their status, they haven’t been posting photos together as frequently. The lack of pictures signifies that the couple may have gone their separate ways.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-young-and-the-restless-stars-mark-grossman-and-sharon-case-broke-up-last-year>‘The Young and the Restless’ stars Mark Grossman and Sharon Case broke up last year</h2><p id=par-5_46>When Mark Grossman joined The Young and the Restless cast in 2019, it impacted his professional and personal life. Grossman is doing remarkable as everyone’s favorite tortured bad boy Adam Newman. Behind the scenes, the actor’s personal life is the talk of the soap opera community.</p><p id=par-6_56>After signing with the CBS soap opera, Grossman began <a href=#>dating his co-star Sharon Case</a>, who plays Adam’s ex-wife Sharon Newman. Grossman and Case kept their relationship private, but flirty Twitter exchanges and Instagram photos sparked dating rumors. It wasn’t until a March 2021 appearance on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">90210MG podcast</a> that Case confirmed they were a couple.</p><p id=par-7_42>Unfortunately, the couple’s relationship has come to an end.
