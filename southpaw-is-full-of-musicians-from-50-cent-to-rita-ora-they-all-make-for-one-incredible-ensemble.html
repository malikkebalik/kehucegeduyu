The film follows the path of boxer Billy Hope, played by an <a href=# class=T3D>insanely jacked Gyllenhaal</a>, who retires at the top of his game only to be pulled back into the sport after his wife is murdered and his daughter is taken away. Yet although the film may appear on the surface to just be mostly about boxing, it also has some strong ties to the music world. A number of musicians show up in <i>Southpaw</i>, flexing their acting muscles for a change instead of their pipes. So many major stars appear in the movie that it's hard to keep track, especially because in most of the cases, the roles are so far from their public personas. Starring in a boxing drama is a huge leap for those previously best known for singing songs about love and fame, to say the least.</p><p>From 50 Cent to Rita Ora, <i>Southpaw</i> is full of familiar faces loved for their work in the music industry, but undoubtedly soon-to-be equally admired for their forays into film. Here's a rundown of all the singers and rappers who appear in the film, along with some appropriate musical accompaniment from the acting newcomers themselves.</p><h3>1. 50 Cent</h3><p></p><p>It's almost hard to remember that Fiddy, who often goes by his real name Curtis Jackson these days, was once the hottest name in hip hop. The guy's music career fizzled long ago and he's become much more recognized over the last several years as an actor (and for apparently <a href=# class=T3D>being worth less than his name sake</a>). In addition to his role of Jordan in <i>Southpaw</i>, Jackson has also appeared in movies like <i>The Rain</i> and <i>Escape Plan</i>, but personally, I'll always remember him best for telling me it's my birthday.</p><h3>2. Rita Ora</h3><p></p><p>British singer Ora is a rising star in both the music scene and the acting world. She's appeared in big budget movies like <i>Fast & Furious 6</i> and <a href=# class=T3D><i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> </a>, and her profile will likely continue to rise after her turn in <i>Southpaw</i>. The 24-year-old shows off her full range of skills, and <a href=# class=T3D>changes up her look about 400 times</a>, in the video for her song "Poison."</p><h3>3. Tyrese Gibson</h3><p></p><p>Another guy who has somewhat shed his musical image in recent years for a spot on the silver screen, Tyrese started his career in the music world before transitioning to acting, where he has had a major impact as one of the stars of the billion-dollar <i>Fast and Furious </i>and <i>Transformers</i> franchises. But Tyrese is still making music, albeit with less fanfare than in the past, and just this month he released the video for his new single, "Shame," which is what you should be feeling if you don't watch it.</p><h3>4. Malcolm Mays</h3><p></p><p>While nowhere near as well known as either a musician or an actor as the others I've mentioned, Mays is no slouch. He started work on his first film, which he wrote, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>at the age of 17</a>, and has gone to appear in several films and shorts in the years since. He's an accomplished rapper, too with a serious artistic vision, as evidenced by his video for "Buss it Open." Also: Twerking.</p><h3>5. Eminem</h3><p></p><p>Eminem isn't in <i>Southpaw</i>, but he was <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>originally supposed to star in the film</a>. He dropped out after deciding to focus on his music career and was replaced by Gyllenhaal. Although he doesn't show up on screen, Em still recorded the lead single for the movie and supervised the music, and I have to say that his work on the film is "Phenomenal" (sorry).</p><h3>6. Jake Gyllenhaal</h3><p></p><p>Sure, he's far better known as an actor than a singer, but his recent turn in <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i> on Broadway (plus this cute clip from an interview, above) proves that he's seriously talented in both professions.</p><p>With so many great singers on-board, will <i>Southpaw: The Musical</i> be up next?</p><p><i>Images: The Weinstein Company</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx6hJRpbmarn6rBqbzAsGSiq12bwq24jKidZqWlqLaktcCnqmaeoqS6boGPZpqepqRiwbB50aKrmmWfp65uwMeesGaZnKF6rq3KnmSfp6I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-shrek-icon-playing-the-mcu-s-galactus-wasn-t-on-our-bingo-card-but-it-still-might-be-ha.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Shrek icon playing the MCUs Galactus wasnt on our bingo card, but it still might be ha</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-dear-david-story-about-a-child-ghost-haunting-a-man-s-apartment-just-got-scarier.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The &amp;quot;Dear David&amp;quot; Story About A Child Ghost Haunting A Man's Apartment Just Got Scarier</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
