Two of the 30 contestants were a woman named Raven Ross and a man named Sikiru “SK” Alagbada.</p><p>During their time in “The Pods,” couples have the option of either getting engaged (without ever seeing one other) or breaking up in search of a more fulfilling romantic partnership. After the proposal, the couples get to know one another more on their honeymoon and during a group dinner with all the other couples.</p><p>When the vacation is over, the couples who reside in the same city move in together to get to know each other’s families and friends before the big day. Each couple faces the age-old dilemma of whether or not love is genuinely blind when they stand at the altar on their wedding days and decide whether or not to marry.</p><h2>After Season 3 of Love Is Blind, who did SK Cheat on Raven with?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Raven-and-SK-from-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>After the third season of Love Is Blind, who was SK’s extramarital affair with and why did he leave Raven? Raven said they broke up after SK cheated on her in the February 2023 finale of Love Is Blind: After the Altar. That’s terrible. A lot of things have moved on since then.</p><p>She continued, “I was so happy. I really was so invested in the person that everyone saw and everyone loved. That’s the person that I saw and I loved every day too. So to see everything that has happened since then is so hard. Because that was not the person I thought I was with.</p><p>I cannot imagine opening up to someone like I opened up to SK. That’s always been my personal challenge and I know it’s a blessing in disguise and I can take that into another relationship. I know in my heart I still believe in love, of course. This is someone I trusted with anything. I still believe in love, and I’m so happy for my friends who have found that. They are my biggest inspiration, and I know it’s coming for me.”</p><p><strong>After the third season of Love Is Blind, who did SK cheat on Raven with?</strong> A lady who goes under the handle <a href=# rel=noopener>@emmwho9</a> on TikTok posted a video in November 2022 claiming to have gone on a date with a Love Is Blind season 3 cast member who was still engaged to the fiancee he met on the show.</p><p>Put your finger down if you went on a date in April with a guy you met on Hinge and later found out was actually on the show Love Is Blind and that he met you after the show was filmed but is still with the same female right now.</p><p><strong>If you want to know about who other celebrities break up from Love is Blind then you can check out the below posts:</strong></p><p>The world is very different from my perspective. SK cheated on me, therefore we can’t be together anymore. Raven stated in a film recorded on her phone months after she and SK got re-engaged on Love Is Blind: After the Altar, “It’s so odd to watch it back and recall my sentiments then.</p><p>She also stated that there was “no question” that she and SK were dating when the cheating claims started. Why would I want to officially commit to someone with whom I was only dating on the side? Why would I spend a year and a half with someone I didn’t care about? she asked.</p><p>To know more details about Sk and raven cheating you can check out this below tweet:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Who did SK cheat on Raven with?

Raven further claimed that in “hindsight,” she should have asked SK more questions.</p><p>If you want to check out more latest articles like this then you can bookmark our site <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> for more latest updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgZ3xygI6rmK%2BdnmKur7CMrKJmm5iarrW1zaBm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chip-esten-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chip Esten Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./which-bell-biv-devoe-member-has-the-highest-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Bell Biv DeVoe Member Has the Highest Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
