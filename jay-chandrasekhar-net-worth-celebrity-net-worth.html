In 2013, Chandrasekhar spoke to "Paste" magazine about experiencing sudden fame after the release of "Super Troopers," stating, "Mostly it manifested itself in every bartender or doorman having seen the film. So we got into every bar, we stopped really paying for drinks, they would keep bar opens until six in the morning. It was this party culture that really embraced us. I think ultimately we were a group of friends who made movies with private jokes that we had and I think everybody and their friends thought, 'oh that's like us.' It continues to this day with 'Beerfest' and 'Slammin' Salmon' and all these movies. It feels like we're very passionately owned by this crowd that likes to smoke grass and drink."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Chandrasekhar has been nominated for three Online Film & Television Association Awards for Best Direction in a Comedy Series, winning for "Community" in 2012.
