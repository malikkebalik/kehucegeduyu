Its a whole mess, and I loved every second of it — except, of course, for some rather contentious conversations between Aaliyah Cosby and Uche Okoroha. The pair found a connection early on, but hit a major roadblock when a conversation about deal-breakers cropped up. With both halves in agreement that honesty was vital, Aaliyah confessed that she cheated in a relationship two years back. Uche didn’t respond well to the news, chastising and judging the Houston-based ICU nurse for her years-old mistake.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>Their relationship never really recovered. Aaliyah was willing to forgive Uche for his overreaction, and continued to put work into their relationship, but the one-two punch of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former relationship with Lydia</a>, and the subsequent oversharing, resulted in an early exit for Aaliyah. Uche was disgruntled by her decision to leave, and as a result — despite a post-Love is Blind attempt at a relationship — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the pair never worked out</a>.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Aaliyah still attended the show’s reunion, despite her early departure, and dished on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">short-lived relationship with Uche</a>, beef with Lydia, and everything else that happened on and off screen. She also revealed that she’s currently in a “beautiful, loving relationship” with someone she met outside the show. So who is this lucky fella?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-aaliyah-dating-now data-injectable=false>Who is Aaliyah dating now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝑨𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒚𝒂𝒉 – 𝑨 𝒂 🤎 (@aalove4_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Aaliyah revealed, during the Love is Blind season 5 reunion, that she is in a happy relationship with “an amazing man” who treats her “like a queen.” She gushed over his chivalry and charm, and noted that the pair met on an R&B cruise awhile back. They appear to be thoroughly happy together, and season 5 viewers couldn’t be more relieved. She deserves much better than the treatment Uche gave her, and this new guy seems to be — finally — showing her the love she deserves.</p><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>We don’t know the lucky man’s name just yet, but he made a notable appearance over on Aaliyah’s Instagram a few days ago. Ahead of Love is Blind‘s big reunion episode, Aaliyah posted a collage on her page, compiling a range of adorable, charming, and all together heartwarming videos and shots of her with her new beau. They make a handsome couple, there’s no denying that, and they seem to make each other genuinely happy. The post is captioned with a simple “My King,” along with a proclamation that this is #whatreallovelookslike.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>What’s more, they may be more than dating. A quick, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shot from mid-way through the collage displays a lovely ring that might just signal the next step in Aaliyah’s real-life love story. It appears that she’s actually engaged to the mystery guy, though we’ll await full confirmation before shouting it from the rooftops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aaliyah_ring.jpg><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Either way, it seems Aaliyah successfully found a partner who she’s perfectly suited to, and without the help of the pods. We couldn’t be happier for it — truly, no one deserves it more — and we’ll be cheering for Aaliyah and her new guy all the way down the aisle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmZGhtrqtx6xkp52nYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGK9sL%2FTZqOorpVitrR5waWgp5xf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-sara-benedikte-nilsen-dating-sara-benedikte-nilsen-s-girlfriend-exes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Sara Benedikte Nilsen Dating Sara Benedikte Nilsen's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taeyeon-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taeyeon Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
