He is one of those celebrities who always seems to be just out of reach. While he is definitely a successful actor, he doesn’t seem to revel in the fame, which means <a href=#>he’s relatively private</a>. Unfortunately for Driver, being a private celebrity only ensures that fans want to know more about you. So, what are some basic facts about the actor? What is Driver’s height? Is he married? Does he have kids?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Star-Wars-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-driver-s-wife>Adam Driver’s wife</h2><p id=par-2_42>Driver is actually married, but not to his Girls costar Lena Dunham or any of the other leading ladies in his projects. Driver and his wife, Joanne Tucker, met at Julliard, which he applied to after being <a href=#>medically discharged from the Marines</a>.</p><p id=par-3_29>“I wanted a challenge,” he once old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a> of after he left the Marines. “The Marine Corps is supposed to be the toughest and most rigorous of its class.”</p><p id=par-4_12>So, he applied to Julliard to challenge himself in a different way.</p><p id=par-5_32>“Obviously the stakes are different,” he said, “You have the risk of getting shot or killed in one and just embarrassed in the other. I thought, ’This will be easy.’ ”</p><p id=par-6_13>After meeting Tucker, the two got married in 2013 in a secret ceremony.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-kids-does-adam-have>How many kids does Adam have?</h2><p id=par-7_45>Driver and Tucker do have a son, who they have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye. As no one knows exactly when the child was born, besides presumably his parents and relatives, Driver’s child is either three or four years old.</p><p id=par-8_25>Fans <a href=#>found out about Driver’s child</a> after Tucker’s sister accidentally made her Instagram account public and eagle-eyed fans noticed the back of the child’s head.</p><p id=par-9_25>While promoting Logan Lucky, Driver’s co-star Channing Tatum accidentally confirmed Driver’s child’s existence. When talking about why Driver doesn’t have parties, Tatum mentioned his son.</p><p id=par-10_12>“Can you imagine you’re just making martinis for your baby,” Tatum said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-is-a-private-person>Adam is a private person</h2><p id=par-11_44>Before joining the Star Wars franchise, Driver’s claim to fame was his role as Adam on HBO’s Girls. However, the his Girls fame was nothing in comparison to what he experienced after he appeared in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.</p><p id=par-12_21>“In my neighborhood, a lot of people watch&nbsp;HBO,” Driver told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>. But everyone watches Star Wars. “Seven-year-olds to 70-year-olds.”</p><p id=par-13_31>“I thought, I’ll ride my bike around the city,” he said, “and within two seconds I got pulled over by the cops, who said, ‘Hey, can we take a picture?’”</p><p id=par-14_15>Though Driver knows fame comes with the job, he enjoys being as private as possible.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_98>“I know people think that if you’re an actor, it’s your goal to be famous and wealthy,” he told the outlet. “Surely you want to be famous and wealthy! And there are great things about that part of it – it frees you up to do other things. But part of my job is being anonymous and I think being able to live, to observe more than to be observed, is important. [Being famous] seems counterintuitive to my job. It’s a weird dynamic when you walk into a room and there’s an image people project on to you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-adam-driver-s-height>What is Adam Driver’s height?</h2><p id=par-16_55>Driver’s looks have led him to be the leading man in several projects. Because he has acted opposite shorter women like Dunham, who is only 5’3″ and Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story, who is the same height, Driver may seem taller than he actually is. So, what is Driver’s height? He is actually only 6’2″.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZpidmZ1isbO11Z6pZqCVnrSpwI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-audra-mcdonald-s-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Audra McDonald's Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-takei-thanks-elliot-page-for-sharing-his-journey-of-coming-out-as-trans.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George Takei thanks Elliot Page for sharing his journey of coming out as trans</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
