McGee (<a href=#>played by Sean Murray</a>) takes center stage. Here’s what happened last time on NCIS.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ncis-season-19-episode-19><strong>‘</strong>NCIS’ Season 19 Episode 19</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Katrina-Law-Wilmer-Valderrama-and-Sean-Murray-on-NCIS.jpg><p id=par-2_39>During NCIS Season 19 Episode 19 (titled “The Brat Pack”), the team investigates a series of break-ins at Quantico. The incidents prompt them to speak to a group of teenagers to see if they are involved in the crimes.</p><p id=par-3_50>Special Agent McGee forms a close bond with Teagan Fields. (Teagan is played by Murray’s real-life daughter, Cay Ryan Murray.) During his investigation, he learns Teagan hacked into the naval base’s security system, allowing her and some of the kids on the base to have parties in the empty houses.</p><p id=par-4_68>McGee connects with Teagan because they had a similar upbringing. Both moved around a lot and frequently changed schools because their parents were in the military. McGee senses Teagan feels alone. She says she’s basically “invisible” to her mother and she has attended seven schools in four years. McGee nods in agreement, saying he went to 12 schools in six years. (Here’s <a href=#>why McGee didn’t take Gibbs’ job</a>.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>McGee defends Teagan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_72>When Knight (<a href=#>played by Katrina Law</a>) calls Tegan a terrorist, McGee immediately jumps to her defense. “She sounds pretty alone,” says McGee. “I could relate to that at her age. We’re not that different. She’s not a terrorist; they were just trying to have some fun.” Knight gives McGee a dose of reality, saying the kids did have fun, but now someone has the master key to the military base in Norfolk.</p><p id=par-6_31>Knight and Parker head to Lieutenant Tang’s house, but it explodes before they can enter. They were going to ask questions about a break-in, but he’s killed before they can investigate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Teagan is the victim of a romance scam</h2><p id=par-7_82>The team figures out Teagan’s boyfriend, Jayden, doesn’t exist. He said he was a 15-year-old boy from Oceanside, but it turns out he’s a catfish. Kasie says metadata from his online Brat Chat account shows he’s around 40 years old and lives in Reston, Virginia. Teagan and Jayden never met in person, so this points to a romance scam. Around the time Jayden and Teagen met, the military base break-ins started. (Here’s <a href=#>what Catfish star Nev Schulman told us about online scams</a>.)</p><p id=par-8_56>McGee says Jayden talked Teagan into hacking into the base server so that people could break into the houses. They recovered deleted text exchanges between Teagan and Jayden, and it shows he was asking a lot of questions about her mother’s experience in the Navy. Her mother had special knowledge that could help with building bombs.</p><p id=par-9_36>“Teagan did not kill Tang,” says McGee. “The catfisher set her up and used her to get on base.” Parker concludes the catfisher built a bomb using parts that could easily be traced back to Teagan.</p><p id=par-10_60>Meanwhile, Teagan is on the run, and no one can find her. The team later discovers she is headed to a mall in Reston so she can meet Jayden. Tang is dead, so there’s no reason for him to continue contacting Teagan. The team realizes he wants to meet her so he can “tie up loose ends” by killing her.</p><p id=par-11_50>McGee intervenes and gets to the location before Teagan can meet Jayden. With her help, they’re able to locate Jayden. His real name is Jason Samuels, and he was in prison for seven years for a hit and run. Tang’s eyewitness testimony put him in prison, so he wanted revenge.</p><p id=par-12_38>At the end of the episode, the case is solved, and Teagan reunites with her mother. Although she’s upset, she forgives her daughter for what happened. It’s clear their relationship has been restored. Tegan no longer feels “invisible.”</p><p id=par-13_14><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=#>‘NCIS’: Gary Cole on What It Takes to Play ‘NCIS’ Boss Alden Parker</a></p><p id=par-14_5>Follow Sheiresa Ngo on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7pLXSZqScn5Waeqe70aaqZqugmrCqrctmmaimlGK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5yKxkq52jqbyzscNnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-the-island-located.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is the Island Located?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-rebecca-ferguson-married-the-reminiscence-star-keeps-her-romantic-life-private.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Rebecca Ferguson Married?
