If you believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you, cheap.</p><p>Billionaire Ziyavudin Magomedov and his brother were arrested in Russia recently. A spokesperson for the Kremlin suggested that these arrests were part of an anti-corruption campaign. HA! Of course they weren't! This is Russia we're talking about.</p><p>Ziyavudin Magomedov is a 49-year-old Russian businessman with a net worth of $1.4 billion. He owns the enormous conglomerate Summa, which has interests in energy, construction, agriculture, and infrastructure. Magomedov was an early investor in Sir <a href=# title="Richard Branson Net Worth">Richard Branson's</a> high speed rail project, Hyperloop One, and currently sits on its board.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-255099 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-939708740.jpg alt width=900 height=582 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-255099 class=wp-caption-text>MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>He is widely believed to be a part of former Russian President <a href=#>Dmitry Medvedev</a>'s inner circle. After his arrest the court refused to release him even on a bail amount of $44 million, which is how much Russian law enforcement is saying he embezzled from infrastructure contracts he was awarded from the government.</p><p>As a rule, Russian moguls with close ties to leading officials are rewarded with lucrative government contracts, such as the one to build infrastructure for Russia's hosting of the World Cup.</p><p>The Magomedov brothers were arrested and accused of being a part of a criminal group. This fact has fueled the rumors that they (and others) have gotten mixed up in infighting in the Kremlin as well as speculation that the arrest is simply a ploy to steal Magomedov's business.</p><p>If they are charged, the brothers face life in prison.</p><p>The arrest came as a surprise to Magomedov. He denied the accusations against him in court. Magomedov's arrest is similar to another billionaire, <a href=# title="Vladimir Yevtushenkov Net Worth">Vladimir Yevtushenkov</a>, in 2014.</p><p>Yevtushenkov bought the oil company Bashneft and was promptly placed &nbsp;under house arrest for several months on suspicion of money laundering. Not so coincidentally, Bashneft was a prized asset that Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, had long wanted to acquire. Yevtushenkov was released and charges were dropped after Bashneft was re-nationalized and auctioned off to Rosneft several months later. Unsurprisingly, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, is a longtime friend and ally of &nbsp;<a href=#>Vladimir Putin</a>.</p><p>Rosneft has long coveted a company co-owned by Summa which could be the reasoning behind the arrests of the Magomedov brothers.</p><p>Russian news outlets have been reporting that the brothers were shocked by the arrests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfoL%2BmucuipWabnJa2rr%2BMq6ysq5mWu26t0aucrKyjYr2ivtNmmKesmWKwsL7RrqetoZ%2Bjeq671Z6knqakZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laz-alonso-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laz Alonso Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-scalia-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jack Scalia Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
