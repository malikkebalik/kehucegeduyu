The South Korean actor has faced significant controversy due to his past homophobic remarks directed at his friend in 2013.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lee Jung-Jae is a highly successful South Korean actor and filmmaker renowned for his outstanding contributions to the industry.</p><p>He has garnered numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Critics’ Choice Television Award.</p><p>In 2021, his role as Seong Gi-hun in Netflix’s “Squid Game” propelled him to international stardom.</p><p>The actor received nominations for prestigious awards, such as the Critics’ Choice Television Award, the Golden Globe Award, the Primetime Emmy Award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><p>Notably, Jung made history as the first male actor from Asia and Korea to be individually nominated in these categories.</p><p>In recognition of his immense talent and achievements, Lee was named Gallup Korea’s Film Actor of the Year in December 2021.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Meet Hayden Christensen Daughter Briar Rose: Wife And Family</a></p><h2>Is Lee Jung-Jae Homophobic?</h2><p>Jung-Jae has faced criticism for saying things that were seen as offensive to gay people.</p><p>In a 2013 interview with Vogue Korea, he appeared to reveal that his friend, Woo Jong-wan, who later died by suicide, was gay.</p><p>During the interview, the actor’s comments made it seem like he told Woo to stop being gay and called it an “inconvenience.”</p><p>Those quotes were later taken out of the online version of the interview.</p><p>Some fans think that these incidents happened a long time ago and believe that people can change and grow.</p><p>However, he has not publicly talked about or made up for what he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/220916-Bunting-Lee-Jung-Jae-tease_psu1rj.jpg><p>We don’t know if Lee has taken any steps to address the issue or change his views because little information is available.</p><p>It’s also important to remember that celebrities’ public images are often carefully managed by the entertainment industry, media, and fans, so it’s hard to know for sure how much someone has changed or learned from their mistakes.</p><h2>Lee Jung-Jae Controversy</h2><p>Lee has faced various controversies throughout his career. In 1999, he and a friend were charged with assault for allegedly attacking someone while they were drunk.</p><p>The following year, he faced assault charges again after reportedly dragging and kicking a woman at a nightclub in Busan, which led to her being hospitalized for two weeks.</p><p>In addition to these assault incidents, the Korean actor has also been involved in drunk driving cases.</p><p>In September 1999, he was accused of crashing his BMW into another vehicle while driving under the influence, with a high blood alcohol concentration of 0.222%.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lee-Jung-Jae-Controversy.jpg><p>Jung denied the accusations, claiming that his manager was driving the car.</p><p>However, in August 2002, he was arrested for driving under the influence and admitted to consuming three bottles of beer before getting behind the wheel.</p><p>These controversies have negatively impacted the filmmaker’s public image and raised concerns about his behavior and decision-making.</p><h2>Lee Jung-Jae Scandal 2023</h2><p>In 2023, there has been a lot of buzz surrounding Jung-Jae’s role in “Squid Game 2.”</p><p>Reports from Korean tabloid media outlet Dispatch have disclosed that she has asked for an astounding fee of more than one million USD for each show episode.</p><p>The news about his “Squid Game 2” fee has caused different reactions online. Some people question if he should be paid that much, while others think his fee is fair compared to what Hollywood actors earn.</p><p>It’s important to know that Lee is highly respected in the Korean entertainment industry and considered a top star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lee-Jung-Jae-Scandal-2023-1024x592.jpg><p>Currently, filming for “Squid Game 2” is scheduled to begin in July 2023, and script reading sessions are currently taking place.</p><p>The news about the actor’s fee has sparked discussions among fans and industry observers about how much actors are worth and the money involved in making TV shows.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Rondell Sheridan Siblings – Where Are They Now?
