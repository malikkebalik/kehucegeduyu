To find their “perfect match” the contestants on the show try to pair off each night.</p><p>Each day, the couples take a compatibility test and the top two are sent on a high-end date while the other couples get to choose two new bombshells to go on dates with. Nick Lachey hosts the Netflix dating reality show.</p><p>Ex-contestants from various Netflix reality shows such as Love Is Blind, Too Hot to Handle, The Circle, The Ultimatum and The Mole move into a villa in a tropical location and begin dating all with the hope of finding true love.</p><p>This post discusses the “Perfect Match” couples who are still together after the show ended.</p><h2><strong>Kariselle Snow and Joey Sasso</strong></h2><p><strong>Joey and Kariselle’s engagement occurs near the season finale</strong>. Joey’s mom gets a call, so it must be true. Even though <a href=# rel=noopener>Kariselle’s Instagram account</a> doesn’t reveal much about their current whereabouts, Joey’s account includes a few photos of them together in the year 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kariselle-Snow-and-Joey-Sasso.jpg><p><strong>Since the older photos haven’t been removed, it’s safe to assume that the couple is still together</strong> even though there is nothing more recent.</p><p>In our previous post, we covered the information related to the couples of other shows’ and you can read about it by the links given below:</p><h2>Lauren Chamblin and Nick Uhlenhuth</h2><p>LC and Nick Uhlenhuth only met in the final episodes. Lauren Chamblin and Nick Uhlenhuth are an atypical couple who joined Perfect Match late in the game. Earlier in the season, we saw Nick form bonds with both Izzy and Ines, before he and they left the villa and began dating others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lauren-Chamblin-and-Nick-Uhlenhuth.jpg><p>Nick was conflicted between LC and Francesca during the episode’s house party when all the contestants were reunited. While on their last date, LC and Nick talked about their hopes for their long-distance relationship and LC told Nic:</p><p>If we can’t figure it out here, I hope we can somewhere else and Nick reassures me that there is hope. I just don’t think we’re a good fit for each other.</p><p>The two still follow each other on social media, but it’s unclear if there’s anything between them. It doesn’t look good for LC that Nick and Bachelorette star Katie Thurston spent New Year’s Eve together in 2023 and that<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Us Magazine reported</a> they were dating the following month.</p><p><strong>Click on the following links to read our previous post, which discusses the couples of various other shows:</strong></p><h2><strong>Dom & Georgia</strong></h2><p><strong>The show’s judges declared Dom Gabriel and Georgia Hassarati the winning couple and awarded them a luxurious vacation</strong>. During the show, host Nick Lachey explained that the purpose of the “pre-honeymoon” was to strengthen your connection and jump-start your life together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Dom-Georgia.jpg><p>Apparently, they weren’t able to turn their romance into a proper honeymoon. <strong>They continue to follow each other on Instagram which can be a useful clue for deducing the status of a reality show couple,</strong> but in this case it’s completely irrelevant.</p><p>Georgia’s relationship with Harry Jowsey, a former cast member of Too Hot to Handle has been very public for quite some time. Harry and Francesca were actually an item in the past. Georgia and Harry’s relationship represents a full circle for Netflix’s romantic comedies.</p><p>Georgia and Harry appeared to take a vacation to Hawaii while Perfect Match was on the air. So it is not yet confirmed whether Dom & Georgia are still together or not.</p><p>These, however, are the couples who are still together after the show “Perfect Match”.
