Self offers four payment plans between $25 and $150 per month, all of which take 24 months to complete. Self doesn't perform a hard credit inquiry, and it reports to all three credit bureaus, but that's the bare minimum for a loan designed to build credit.</p><strong class="financial-product-card__product-details__title headline-bold">Product Details</strong><ul class="financial-product-card__product-details__list headline-regular"><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>No hard credit report pull</li><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>Reports to all 3 bureaus</li><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>Build credit AND savings</li><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>Join over 1 million credit builders</li><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>Unlock a Secured Credit Card after meeting eligibility criteria</li><li class=financial-product-card__product-details__list-item>24 months loan duration</li></ul><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Credit invisibility</a> can often be a negative feedback loop where you can't get a loan because you don't have credit, but you can't build credit because you can't get approved. Enter the credit-builder loan, which has you paying the entire loan off before you get your money. This structure protects lenders from risk, so they can accept people with bad or no credit, and the borrowers' payments still get reported to credit bureaus so they can <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>improve credit scores</a>.</p><p>Large banks like Bank of America or American Express usually don't offer credit builder loans, so borrowers usually have to look regionally, like a <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>local credit union</a>. However, as one of the loans we included in our guide on the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>best credit-builder loans</a>, Self's credit-builder loan is one of the few available nationwide. See how Self can help raise your credit score and if it's right for you.</p><p><strong>Read more: <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Loans for no credit.</a></strong></p><h2 data-toc-label="Self Credit Builder Loan Overview" id=self-credit-builder-loan-overview class=toc-anchor>Self Credit Builder Loan Overview</h2><p>Self, an Austin, Texas-based startup founded in 2014, is an online lender that offers credit-builder loans that help customers with little or no credit build up their payment history. Self claims that the average customer raises their <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>credit score</a> by 49 points.</p><p><a rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noindex" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-analytics-product-id=6335a6041262460018d12976 data-analytics-product-brand=Self data-analytics-product-name="Self Credit Builder Account" href=# data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=0d599fed8465bdb901db9d18636191b54fbe657ad2837f6a4660c80f7685f3df&u=https%3A%2F%2Fself-lender.3qcw.net%2Fc%2F4722637%2F635357%2F10159">Self's credit builder loan</a> is one of the few credit-builder loans available in all 50 states. Self offers four payment plans between $25 and $150 per month, all of which take 24 months to complete. Self doesn't perform a <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>hard credit inquiry</a>, and it reports to all <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>three credit bureaus</a>, but that's the bare minimum for a loan designed to build credit.</p><p>Self's biggest draw is its Visa secured credit card that you are eligible for after you make three on-time payments and have paid at least $100 into your credit-builder account. The <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>secured credit card</a> also comes with a $25 annual fee and an APR that hovers around 28.24% (Variable).</p><p>On the other hand, Self's relatively high APRs from 15.72%-15.97% make it a tough sell. Additionally, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Better Business Bureau gave Self a B rating</a> for the high volume of complaints the company received. Customers on Self's BBB page gave the company an average of 3.37 stars out of five across nearly 600 reviews. The company fares worse on Trustpilot, receiving an average of 1.5 stars across 90 reviews. Most negative reviews cite poor customer service, issues retrieving funds after completing the loan, and high fees.&nbsp;</p><p>The BBB has put out an alert on Self over the numerous reports of fraud and difficulty receiving payments coming from consumers. As of August 25, 2023, the Self has communicated with the BBB, detailing its efforts to improve fraud detection and customer communication.</p><p>Overall, Self is one of the more accessible credit-builder loans on the market. Still, it's worth your time to look at all options, particularly local options, for better rates and potentially more reliable service.</p><h2 data-toc-label="How Self Credit Builder Works" id=how-self-credit-builder-works class=toc-anchor>How Self Credit Builder Works</h2><p>Self credit builder works by issuing a loan to be paid off over 24 months. As you make payments on-time and in full, you will qualify for the Self Visa <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>secured credit card</a>, and Self will report your payment activity to the credit bureaus as an installment loan. Here are the details:</p><p>The first step is to choose a loan based on how much you want to pay monthly.</p><p>You can select from four monthly payment amounts, which you'll make for 24 months:</p><p>After you've made your pick, fill out an application for a credit-builder account, which is backed by Self's <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>FDIC-approved financial partners</a>. Once approved, you can activate your account with a one-time, non-refundable $9 administrative fee.</p><p>At that point, Self will issue your loan — but instead of giving you the funds directly, it'll put the money into a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>certificate of deposit (CD)</a> where it earns interest. The interest isn't great enough to cancel out your APR, but it shaves some expenses off the top.</p><p>You will qualify for the Self Visa secured credit card when you've made three on-time payments and deposited at least $100. The money you've deposited to pay off the loan secures your credit card and doubles as your <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>credit limit</a>. You can increase that credit limit as you continue to pay off your loan.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Self Visa secured credit card also doesn't require a hard credit check.&nbsp;</p><p>Self reports your payment activity to the credit bureaus as you make your monthly payments. Payment history makes up 35% of your <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>FICO credit score</a> and 40% of your <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>VantageScore</a>, so the ability to show bureaus that you can deliver timely payments can go a long way toward getting you on the right track credit-wise. The loan will also be reported as an installment loan, which can help add diversity to your credit accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>When you've paid off the loan, the CD will unlock, and the money you've paid will be returned, minus any unpaid fees and interest. Your money is usually returned within 10-14 days, but it may take up to 30 days for Self to return your funds.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Self Rent and Utilities Reporting" id=self-rent-and-utilities-reporting class=toc-anchor>Self Rent and Utilities Reporting</h3><p>While making payments toward your credit builder loan will help you build payment history, Self's new rent and utilities reporting through LevelCredit will allow you to build credit using monthly expenses you're already making. The service is competitive with some of the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>best rent reporting services</a>.</p><p>For no charge, Self's rent reporting service will report your rent payments to the three credit bureaus. You can opt into the paid plan for $6.95 monthly to add utility payments to your TransUnion credit report. Along with reported utility payments, paying users also receive $1 million in identity theft insurance and credit monitoring through TransUnion. Users can also add up to 24 months of prior rent payments at your current lease for a one-time $49.95 fee.&nbsp;</p><p>Users to not need to sign up for a Self credit builder loan to gain access to rent reporting.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Self Credit Builder Pros and Cons" id=self-credit-builder-pros-and-cons class=toc-anchor>Self Credit Builder Pros and Cons</h2><p>Self credit builder pros include flexible payment options, nationwide availability, and access to the Self Visa secured credit card. Cons include relatively high APRs and non-refundable fees.</p><h3>Self credit builder pros</h3><p><strong>Payment flexibility:</strong> While Self offers four payment plans, they also don't penalize you for paying your loan off early or canceling your credit-builder account.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wide availability:&nbsp;</strong>Self is available in all 50 states, which is rare for providers of these kinds of loans. Additionally, Self has relatively few requirements to qualify. Some lenders provide a credit-builder account with a wider paid subscription program. Other lenders will have specific region-based requirements. For Self, you just need:</p><ul><li>To be at least 18 years old</li><li>To be a permanent US resident</li><li>Have a Social Security number</li><li>Have a bank account</li></ul><p><strong>Includes Self Visa secured credit card:&nbsp;</strong>The Visa secured credit card also sets Self apart from other credit-builder loan providers. You can use this to show additional payment history and further build your credit. That said, this secured card needs to be used carefully since your credit limit will initially be low with a minimum deposit of $100. If your <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>utilization ratio</a> gets too high, above 30% at the most, you will hurt your credit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Self credit builder cons</h3><p><strong>Relatively high APR:&nbsp;</strong>With APRs between 15.72%-15.97%, the Self credit builder loan is on the high side compared to other credit-builder accounts on the market. Compare that with something like <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Digital Credit Union's credit builder</a>, which has a 5.00% APR.</p><p><strong>Non-refundable fees:&nbsp;</strong>High APRs aside, Self requires an up-front $9 non-refundable processing fee. The Self Visa secured credit card also has a $25 annual fee.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bad customer service:&nbsp;</strong>Self has a high number of negative reviews, flagging poor customer service and trouble getting money back after the 24 months are up.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="How Self Credit Builder Compares To Its Competition" id=how-self-credit-builder-compares-to-its-competition class=toc-anchor>How Self Credit Builder Compares To Its Competition</h2><p>While Self is one of the more established credit builder loans with availability in all 50 states, that's quickly becoming less impressive as more credit-building products hit the market. Meanwhile Self's high interest rates and poor customer service are starting to raise more eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how Self compares to other credit-builder loans in cost, monthly payments, and loan length:</p><h3>Self vs. CreditStrong</h3><p>Self and CreditStrong are leading providers in credit builder loans. Self is available in all 50 states and CreditStrong is available in 48. The two services are also very similar in fee structure, charging a setup fee and interest on the remaining loan balance.&nbsp;</p><p>CreditStrong offers slightly better interest rates and more flexible loan terms. While CreditStrong's Instal loans can last anywhere between 24 to 48 months, Self only offers 24-month loan terms.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Self's secured credit card is a s, which is secured by the amount you've already contributed to your credit builder loan. This is a great perk which adds a revolving line of of credit to your credit report without a hard inquiry. It's also cheaper than CreditStrong's Revolv account, costing just $25 annually compared to Revolv's $99 annual fee.</p><p>Read our <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>CreditStrong review</a> here.</p><h3>Self vs. Fizz</h3><p>It's hard to argue with a free service, which is exactly what Fizz offers. Fizz is a debit card that reports your transactions to all three credit bureaus. It does not charge any interest on your balance and there's no setup fee. Fizz also has guard rails in place so you don't overspend without paying off your existing balance.</p><p>The one advantage Self has over Fizz is that Fizz is a revolving line of credit. If you already have a credit card, Fizz won't be nearly as helpful compared to Self, which is an <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>installment loan</a>. However, for simple, cheap credit building, Fizz is a better deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Fizz review</a> here.</p><h2 data-toc-label="Who Is Self Credit Builder For?" id=who-is-self-credit-builder-for? class=toc-anchor>Who Is Self Credit Builder For?</h2><p>The Self credit builder is for a specific consumer. If you have no credit or a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>damaged credit score in need of repair</a> and you have a flexible budget, Self could be a convenient option for you. Its large builder plan would have you paying $1,152 over 24 months and getting $992 in return, costing a total of $169.</p><p>If you're not sure you'll be able to make your payments, it's probably not the best time to start a Self account. The service reports your payment activity and whether or not your payments are on time. Missing a payment may <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>cause your credit score to drop</a>. Self also charges a late fee, 5% of your monthly payment.</p><p>Self, and any other credit-building loan, is a means to an end. Yes, you can view Self as a way to save money and build credit, but if you want to save money, Self is far from the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>best savings account</a>. You can also find better secured credit cards than the Visa secured card that Self offers. The <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>best secured credit cards</a> come with no annual fee, better APRs, and even some benefits.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-toc-label="Frequently Asked Questions" id=frequently-asked-questions class=toc-anchor>Self Credit Builder Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><p class=faq-answer>With each payment you make to Self, you <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>build credit</a>. All Self payment plans take 24 months to complete. However, if you don't have a credit score, it will take approximately six months before your credit file is scorable by the credit scoring algorithms.</p><p class=faq-answer>The results of your Self credit builder will vary, but you will likely see a boost in your credit score as you add positive payment history information to your credit report. You will also add an installment loan onto your credit report, which can help if you only have <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>revolving credit accounts</a> like credit cards. According to Self's website, the average customer sees a 49-point boost in their credit score.&nbsp;</p><p class=faq-answer>Yes, Self credit builder and its services are legitimate.
