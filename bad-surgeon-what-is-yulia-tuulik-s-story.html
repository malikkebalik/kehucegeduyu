Many of Macchiarini’s patients faced life-threatening conditions, but Yulia Tuulik underwent the procedure when her life was not at risk.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>As explained in the Netflix <strong><a href=#>true crime</a></strong> documentary series <strong><a href=#>Bad Surgeon: Love Under the Knife</a></strong>, Macchiarini’s supposed groundbreaking treatment turned controversial when many of his patients later died. His claims about the medical procedure were among many falsehoods revealed in his public and private life.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>As of 2012, Tuulik was a 34-year-old Russian woman whose trachea was damaged in a car wreck but had other medical interventions that helped her breathe. According to Macchiarini, however, his new procedure would improve her quality of life and return her speech.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>But like several other Macchiarini patients, Tuulik’s trust in the surgeon may have cost her life.</p><h2 id=h-tuulik-s-first-trachea-collapsed data-injectable=false>Tuulik’s first trachea collapsed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>Disgraced surgeon Paolo Macchiarini performed not one but two trachea-replacement surgeries on Yulia Tuulik in Russia, where he was employed at the time. Tuulik’s first surgery happened in 2012, and after the operation, Tuulik was breathing and speaking, according to <a href=#>New Scientist</a>. Macchiarini also claimed that stem cells were beginning to grow on the plastic trachea he implanted. The results were “very emotional,” Macchiarini said that year.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Tuulik’s initial procedure seemed successful and captured headlines all over the world. Growing synthetic human organs in this method seemed possible. But not long after Tuulik’s first surgery, her manufactured trachea collapsed, and it had to be replaced.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tuulik died in 2014</h2><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>After Yulia Tuulik’s second Paolo Macchiarini trachea was implanted, problems persisted, and Tuulik died in 2014. Little else is known about Tuulik’s life in this period or what caused her death, but the Netflix Bad Surgeon series does include an email written by Tuulik before she died. In it, she described what she called “rotting” in the area on her body where the surgery happened. The smell was so pungent, she said, that “<a href=#>people shudder away</a>.”</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Tuulik was just one of many deaths linked with Macchiarini’s disputed procedure at Russia’s Krasnodar Hospital and other healthcare institutions worldwide. Maccharini was fired from Krasnodar when it was revealed he was practicing medicine in Russia without proper licensing.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>Maccharini performed many similar operations in his career. In seven of the eight most well-known cases, though, the patient later died. After complications, Macchiarini’s eighth patient removed the implant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX5eupXnSrqmgnZ%2Bjeri0wK1koqtdrsKttcBmq66tnJ64tHnSraarsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruna-burns-wiki-gilbert-burns-wife-bio-age-relationships-career-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruna Burns: Wiki (Gilbert Burns Wife), Bio, Age, Relationships, Career, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-hamill-issues-emotional-statement-on-kevin-conroy-s-passing-he-will-always-be-my-batman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
