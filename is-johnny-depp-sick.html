The actor went into more detail regarding his injury via his Instagram story at the end of last month.</p><p>“My dear friends, I am sorry to say that I have fractured my ankle, which is a drag. […] several medical professionals have strongly suggested I avoid any and all activity for the moment and so am sadly unable to travel at this time.”</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=false>After a week of recovery Depp performed with the Hollywood Vampires once again and his fellow bandmate, Alice Cooper, was even able to get the fans to sing happy birthday to the star as the clock struck midnight. It’s safe to say that he’s doing better now considering he is able to perform, and for all of you who were worried you can breathe a sigh of relief as he is most definitely not sick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnJqJ%2Bnpqlisaa8z2aqopubZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./were-miley-cyrus-john-mayer-all-over-each-other-during-grammy-weekend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Were Miley Cyrus &amp;amp; John Mayer all over each other during Grammy weekend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elon-musk-s-new-twitter-logo-alienates-users-and-walks-straight-into-a-potential-copyright-infring.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elon Musks new Twitter logo alienates users and walks straight into a potential copyright infring</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
