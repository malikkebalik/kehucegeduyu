Reynolds likes to keep his family life private but loves to interact with his fans on social media. He’s also well known for his sarcastic, hilarious social media posts. It is thanks in part to these posts that have created a rumor regarding Ryan Reynolds having a twin brother. Over the past few years, many fans have wondered if the charismatic actor does, in fact, have a twin brother — and the answer is somewhat complicated.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-reynolds-interviewed-his-twin-gordon-for-a-gq-interview>Ryan Reynolds interviewed his ‘twin’ Gordon for a GQ interview</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ryan-reynolds-2019-premiere.jpg><p id=par-2_70><a href=#>Reynolds</a> first introduced his “twin brother” Gordon in an interview with GQ, after the publication gave him a special award. In the interview, the actor can be seen sitting across from an identical version of himself, created with the help of some clever camera tricks. The interview for GQ was made to look very convincing, with special guests like Jake Gyllenhaal even popping in to help “sell” the spoof interview.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_76>Since that interview, Gordon has popped up on several occasions, including in a special video segment to promote Reynolds’ brand of gin. In the process, he has managed to make many fans all over the world believe that Gordon is a real person. New fans have taken to social media to ask about his supposed twin brother — and several times, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reynolds himself has responded</a>, always acting as though he is completely in on the joke.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-kate-beckinsale-say-about-being-ryan-reynolds-doppelganger>What did Kate Beckinsale say about being Ryan Reynolds’ doppelganger?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_91>Interestingly enough, there’s one celebrity who believes that she could be related to Ryan Reynolds. Kate Beckinsale, the well-known English actress, has joked that she believes she bears a remarkable resemblance to the Deadpool actor. In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Jimmy Fallon</a>, Beckinsale opened up about the physical similarities between her and Reynolds. “I look exactly like Ryan Reynolds,” she said in the interview. “Like in a shocking way. Like sometimes I see a bus going by with a poster on and I think, ‘Damn, I look hot. Wait, it’s not me.'”</p><p id=par-5_50><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reynolds himself responded</a> to Beckinsale’s statements in an interview with Hoda Kotb, saying, Iit is like looking in a mirror … This has been something I’ve heard for a long time. Other people have said it to me, as well. We met one time, but yeah, I [have heard it].”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-in-reality-reynolds-has-three-brothers-none-of-which-are-twins>In reality, Reynolds has three brothers — none of which are twins</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_70>Reynolds might not actually have a twin brother named Gordon, but he does have three siblings in real life. The youngest of four children, Reynolds has three older brothers: Jeffrey, who works as a police officer; Terry, a Mountie in British Columbia, Canada; and Patrick, who is described as a “jack of all trades,” an intensely creative type who is expert at thinking outside the box and helping the community.</p><p id=par-7_46>As for his experience growing up as the youngest of four boys, Reynolds has joked that it was “intense” and that he developed strong survival skills from an early age. In fact, Reynolds credits his siblings as helping to prepare him for Deadpool, his best-known role.</p><p id=par-8_43>“It’s something I always related to and I think that’s why I connected to the character 11 years ago. As a kid, I was the youngest of four boys. I wasn’t considered a younger brother, I was considered a moving target,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reynolds joked</a>.</p><p id=par-9_34>For fans, while they might not get the chance to see any of Reynolds’ brothers in a public forum, his sketch involving his mythical “twin” provides yet another opportunity to enjoy his one-of-a-kind humor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLHSZqmymZ5iv6bFzaijnatdna63sYyaZK2vmaN7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eden-sassoon-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eden Sassoon Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-rappers-who-have-had-serious-money-problems.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Rappers Who Have Had Serious Money Problems</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
