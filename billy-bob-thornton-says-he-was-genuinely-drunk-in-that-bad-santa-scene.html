The cult comedy classic went down well with most audiences but was slammed by some for showing an incarnation of Santa who was crass, vulgar and perpetually intoxicated. And now, Thornton has revealed in a new interview that he took the ‘drunk’ part of the character to method acting extremes, particularly for the infamous drunken rampage scene.</p>Recommended Videos<p>“I drank about three glasses of red wine for breakfast… Then I switched over to vodka and cranberry juice, and then I had a few Bud Lights. By the time I got to that scene there, I barely knew I was in a movie.”</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Of course, this incident is only one indication of a serious alcohol problem that Thornton was dealing with at the time. While committed to being as professional as possible for the duration of shooting, the actor’s after-work revelry with friends often had a negative impact on his performance during production, with Billy Bob saying:</p><p>“A couple of times, I was drunk, but not every day. I showed up with a hangover a few times. There were times when I’d be with my pals until 3:30 a.m. and have to be at work at 7 a.m. I wasn’t the most pleasant guy to be around.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bad-santa-2-billy-bob-thornton-670x335.jpg alt="Bad Santa" width=640 height=320 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>All of this led to more than a few standoffs between the actor and director of the film, Terry Zwigoff. So much so that when the producers wanted to reshoot certain portions of the movie, Zwigoff flatly refused to work with Thornton again, and instead, Todd Phillips, of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joker fame</a>, was brought in to add some scenes which aimed to inject more heart into the pic and give the protagonist something of a redemptive arc for audiences to sympathize with.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>While the making of the movie was riddled with difficulties, <strong>Bad Santa</strong> managed to be a hit at the box office and even garnered positive reviews from critics, which is a rare feat for small budget Christmas flicks. Both Thornton and Zwigoff have buried the hatchet over the years, too, noting that at least they were able to put out a movie that’s stood the test of time and added an unlikely comedy credit to Thornton’s resume, who was until then mostly known for working in serious dramas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZqcXaiur8DAZpurrZ6gerSvxKecZp6VlsG2vsSdZKCdnqq2r7HLsmSdqqWjuG6uyKWjsmWSpK9uwMeoqaesn6N6s7HVnpilZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-andrews-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Andrews Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-edison-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Edison Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
