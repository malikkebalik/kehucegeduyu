In 1960, Pollack was invited by his friend John Frankenheimer to come to Los Angeles to work as a dialogue coach for the child actors in Frankenheimer's film "The Young Savages." While working in that position, Pollack met actor <a href=# title="Burt Lancaster Net Worth">Burt Lancaster</a>, who urged him to try his hand at directing.

His next film was his most acclaimed yet: the 1969 psychological drama "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?," starring <a href=# title="Jane Fonda Net Worth">Jane Fonda</a>. Focused on a group of people competing to win a Depression-era dance marathon, the film earned nine Academy Award nominations, including Pollack's first for Best Director.

Together, they had three children named Steven, Rebecca, and Rachel. The couple remained together for 50 years until Pollack's passing from cancer in 2008.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In June 2011, several months after his widow Claire's death, the longtime Pollack family home was put on the market for $7.9 million. Located in LA's Pacific Palisades neighborhood, Sydney and Claire bought the 1-acre property in 1985 for $1.8 million. The property's mansion, which was built in the 1940s, was designed by famed architect Wallace Neff.
