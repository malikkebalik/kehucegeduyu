Moore’s high-profile relationships with fellow Hollywood heavyweights like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce Willis</a> and Ashton Kutcher have kept Moore’s name in the headlines.</p><p id=par-2_61>But as for the actor herself, she has always preferred to keep the emphasis squarely on her work. Unfortunately, not all of her big-budget movies have been well-received by the critics, and in 1996, Moore appeared in the film that would do major damage to her credibility, ultimately earning the actress a Razzie Award and sidelining her film career for years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-demi-moore-was-one-of-the-biggest-stars-of-the-early-90s>Demi Moore was one of the biggest stars of the early ’90s</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_64><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moore</a> was born in New Mexico in 1962. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a young model</a> and aspiring actress, Moore first rose to fame in the ’80s as a member of the infamous “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brat Pack</a>.” A few of her early films included teen dramas like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Elmo’s Fire</a> and Blame It on Rio. Critics and fans loved Moore for her striking, exotic beauty, and her signature husky voice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_37>In 1990, Moore had her big breakthrough when she starred opposite Patrick Swayze in the romantic thriller Ghost. Her work in the movie was praised and she even earned a Golden Globe nomination for her role.</p><p id=par-5_52>In the years that followed, Moore continued to make waves in Hollywood, appearing in movies such as Indecent Proposal and Disclosure. She cemented her status as a sex symbol but also proved that she wasn’t afraid to tackle tough roles — even ones that other, established actresses might consider to be taboo.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-the-movie-striptease-hurt-demi-moore-s-career>How did the movie ‘Striptease’ hurt Demi Moore’s career?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_63>In 1996, Moore played the lead role in the movie Striptease, portraying Erin Grant, a working mother who takes on a job in a strip club in order to provide for herself and her young daughter. Although Moore received a hefty paycheck for her work in the film, reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">banking $12.5 million</a>, the film ultimately did a lot of damage to her career.</p><p id=par-7_43>According to a report by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MovieMonkeyShoot</a>, Moore’s performance in Striptease was slammed, and the movie was a box-office bomb. Moore was even nominated for a “worst actress” award at that year’s Razzie Awards, with people staying away from the film in droves.</p><p id=par-8_23>It would be years before Moore would star in another big-budget movie, making a return to form in the 2009 film The Joneses.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-demi-moore-s-net-worth-today>What is Demi Moore’s net worth today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Demi-Moore.jpg><p id=par-9_56>Striptease wasn’t the only mid-90s film of Moore’s that wasn’t well-received. Just the following year, Moore won a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Worst Actress Award</a> at the 1997 Razzie Awards for her work in The Juror. The drama was critically slammed, and between that film, Striptease, and G.I. Jane, Moore decided that a hiatus from Hollywood was her best bet.</p><p id=par-10_81>Post-2009, Moore returned to the acting world, appearing in several high-profile movies, and seemingly leaving behind all trace of drama from the movies that had come so close to tanking her career in the mid-90s. At the end of the day, the bad reviews that Moore got from Striptease probably didn’t affect her on a personal level all that much — considering that she has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a reported net worth</a> of $200 million, and lives a fabulously privileged life in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxprnIZqSop6KawG6vwKucnqpdoLatuMinnmaqn6GybsPArKWtZZiav26ywK1kqZmpmLWmr8pnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ebro-darden-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ebro Darden Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cooper-hefner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cooper Hefner Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
