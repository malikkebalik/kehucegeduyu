If Brad is following the Amal Path, then… I think he’ll probably just allow the rumor mill and gossip industry to do their work for a few months. It’s too soon for Brad and Neri to be photographed together, and I don’t think he would rush it, especially given how slowly he rolled out the IDEA of a girlfriend before we found out Neri Oxman’s identity. She was only identified two weeks ago and there’s already been about three dozen major stories about their romance, their love, their joint brilliance, their sexiness. My guess is that mid-summer, maybe, is when we’ll see the first photos of Brad and Neri together. Maybe I’m wrong. But here’s a question: do you think Neri Oxman is having second thoughts? Us Weekly says that even though Neri and Brad are “infatuated” with each other, she’s already mourning the lack of privacy.</p><p>Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman are still going strong.</p><p>“They continue to talk on the phone several times a day and are very infatuated with each other,” a source tells Us Weekly exclusively of the couple, who have been seeing each other for six months. “Their busy schedules are going to be a huge challenge because Neri isn’t going to give up her life in Cambridge or her job at MIT for anyone, even Brad Pitt.”</p><p>In the meantime, the duo — who are based on opposite coasts — are focused on spending time with one another and not worrying about the future. “They are going to have fun and see where it goes,” the insider added. Although the twosome have managed to keep their romance under wraps, they’ve been thrust into the spotlight since news of their relationship broke. “Neri is extremely uncomfortable with all of the media attention and feels that her personal life has now come under a microscope,” said the pal of the architectural designer, 42. “Brad feels badly about this of course, but he is powerless to stop it.”</p><p>Despite prying eyes, a source exclusively revealed to Us earlier this month that Pitt is “absolutely smitten by” Oxman and “their chemistry is off the charts.” Even more, the War Machine actor “is glowing” around his new love and friends “can hear his grin” when speaking to him.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>There are several lines that made me laugh. “Neri isn’t going to give up her life in Cambridge or her job at MIT for anyone, even Brad Pitt.” Yeah but she sure dumped her billionaire boyfriend is a hurry, right? And she sure gave up her privacy as soon as People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive came walking into her office, right? And this one is a knee-slapper: “Brad feels badly about this of course, but he is powerless to stop it.” LMAO!!! Brad orchestrated this entire Neri Oxman Rollout!! OH MY GOD.</p><p>Meanwhile, Neri Oxman – who is super-private, you guys, she hates the attention! – granted an interview to CNN this week. <a href=#>You can read the full piece here.</a> Some highlights:</p><p><strong>What’s on her desk:</strong> “Books: The Art of Structure, The Complete Book of Pyramids, The Genius of Judaism, MIES IN BERLIN, Cosmic Ecology. Creatures: a collection of Alebrijes, an elephant skull, a glass printed prototype, Henry Moore’s unpublished drawings, Virgil in English, Bernstein’s Unanswered Question. Why Buddhism is True, The Rise and Fall of Adam And eve. Flowers, I make my own arrangements. Emily Dickinson’s’ Envelope Poems, Arabic Poems.</p><p><strong>A place that inspires her:</strong> “Walden Pond, the Chauvet Cave, the local hospital, the Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem, the market in the Old City, the Atacama Desert, old people’s homes, my grandmother’s garden (only by memory), the Wailing Wall, Taliesin West, my childhood home, an open sea, my mother’s arms.</p><p><strong>Who inspires her: </strong>“Susan Sontag, Beethoven, Bergman, Bernstein, Perriand, Virginia Woolf, Mies van der Rohe, Maureen Dowd, and Maria Popova, also a dear friend. Every member on my team, Gershon Dublon. My sister, my parents, my close friends, Edgar Allan Poe, Isaiah Berlin, Uber drivers who care about what they play.</p><p><strong>Whether she would describe herself as a feminist: </strong>“Although I often find that the feminist rhetoric—not feminism—can come across as simple-minded, self-regarding, nuance-averse and reductive: biology to physiology, history to psychology, procreation to gynecology, and so on; I have come to realize that we should all be feminists. Gender is more of a continuum than we are willing to admit when we hit the restroom. We must pursue social equality, confound label-based gender norms and embrace complexity. I loathe categorization, I cherish my independence, and I treasure chivalry. I live just fine with ambiguity and I welcome a good quarrel about all things designed or grown—except for when men misnomer “confident” with “poised” and “passionate” with “feisty”. I work hard.</p><p><a href=#>[From CNN]</a></p><p>Whenever I encounter or hear about a woman like this – truly intellectual, likely a genius, serious, accomplished, bookish, cerebral – I always wonder if there will be anything to really talk about with her. Does she like Rihanna? Does she have any thoughts on Riccardo Tisci taking over Burberry? Does she think Taylor Swift is queen of the snakes? I mean, I can talk about books all day long as well, but I like to gossip and chat about pop culture and the weather and who got hair plugs and who got too much Botox. I have the feeling that if I brought up any of those subjects, Neri would look at me blankly and go on a lengthy diatribe about ancient sundials.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BGUS_1208249_0131.jpg alt="Neri Oxman rocks all black and carries &#34;The Voyager Record'' while heading to class at MIT" width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm9kaX11e82eqaKXn626orq%2Bm6manI%2BltrXAvpqpnpeZo7OiwNSaq56cj6y2tbS%2BnpicoI%2Bkwamx0ZirmqSblLyvq9OhnJiomKS7pqvCqKWsrJGjwa3Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-complicated-billionaire-behind-the-dakota-access-pipeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Complicated Billionaire Behind The Dakota Access Pipeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-the-originals-rebekah-stuck-in-her-new-body-permanently-don-t-count-on-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is 'The Originals' Rebekah Stuck In Her New Body Permanently?
