Her father, James, worked as a sales manager, and her mother, Mary (better known as Peg), was a teacher. Sadly, when Molly was 4 years old, her mother, younger sister, and cousin were killed in a car accident. Her father, who was under the influence, was driving the car, and while he was recovering in the hospital, Molly and her older sister, Mary, lived with their aunt. Shannon said of the tragedy, "I was very heartbroken and very sad and just trying to hold it all together as a kid. There's no way that you could feel that type of deep pain about your mother and your sister being dead, so you just hold it all in, and it comes up later in life." Molly eventually channeled her feelings from that time in her life into creating Mary Katherine Gallagher, who became a popular recurring character on "Saturday Night Live."
