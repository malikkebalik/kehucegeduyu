The all-male band with the sultry female blonde singer had enormous hits during the decade including Heart of Glass, Call Me, and The Tide is High, to name just a few.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-2637336.jpg><p id=par-2_20>Find out what lead singer Deborah Harry has been up to, plus her net worth and whether she has children.</p><h2>Harry isn’t really blonde</h2><p id=par-3_17>The founder of the 1980s new wave band dyed her hair blonde. She’s actually a natural redhead.</p><p id=par-4_34>Harry penned a <a href=#>2017 essay for InStyle</a> in which she said, “My own hair was strawberry blonde with a lot of red in it. In the summer my highlights would really come out.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_45>“In 1974, when I was in my first band, the Stilettos, I actually had short brown hair. But by the time Chris Stein and I formed [our band] a few years later, I was working as a beautician and I was back to blond.”</p><p id=par-6_35>“I was walking across Houston Street to meet Chris and someone yelled ‘Hey, Blondie!’ at me. We’d been trying to think of a band name, and I was like, ‘Blondie—that’s good. Let’s do that.’</p><h2>Harry just published her memoir</h2><p id=par-7_53>The One Way or Another singer just released <a href=#>her memoir, </a><a href=#>Face It</a>, in October 2019. It’s Harry’s fascinating take on a lot of jaw-dropping topics including her rough and tumble early years in New York City, her sexual assault at knifepoint, Harry’s claim of almost being abducted by Ted Bundy, and much more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_20><a href=#>GQ</a><a href=#> asked her in September</a> this year why she was choosing to write her memoir now, after all these years.</p><p id=par-9_49>“I guess I was a coward really. I never really thought of doing it and I never really wanted to do it especially. People came to me and said, ‘Oh, you’ve got all of these great stories, you really ought to tell them,’ but I was kind of reluctant.”</p><p id=par-10_56>“There are lots of stories in the book that aren’t just me and so-and-so going out and having a night or doing this or doing that…I suppose the book is an overall kind of broad brushstroke book, trying to externalize internal events. In the end, I just had to stop or else I’d still be writing.”</p><h2>Her net worth and family</h2><p id=par-11_12>Deborah Harry’s <a href=#>net worth is $20 million</a> according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p id=par-12_27>At the age of 74, she hasn’t yet married nor had children. She was in a long-term relationship with her bandmate Chris Stein, which ended in 1989.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-13_11>She discussed the #MeToo <a href=#>movement with The Guardian</a> in October.</p><p id=par-14_54>“I was working as a team and in a relationship. I wouldn’t have felt comfortable being a solo artist and I’m sure that those girls have a lot more to say about that than I do.” It’s important to note, according to Harry, that #MeToo, “makes men stop and think about their accepted behavior.”</p><p id=par-15_23>She seemed surprised and impressed with how far women have come now in the music world. “It’s a radical change,” she says.</p><p id=par-16_37>“I always admire young women who are so gifted [at] writing and performing. It’s wonderful and that’s an inspiration for me, even though I’ve gone over the hill, as it were. I’m climbing up the other side.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BeoSPrGSbmZ6ZeqO4zqebop1drLWiwIyiqmaclZe8s63HZp%2BaqqKuwG66xK1ksKeiqbVurc2dZJ2nlah6tLTEZp%2BarpVisKm1y52pnqZencGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-was-bonanza-actor-dan-blocker-s-net-worth-at-his-time-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Was 'Bonanza' Actor Dan Blocker's Net Worth at His Time of Death?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-clark-addresses-his-nearly-invisible-edit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Clark Addresses His Nearly Invisible Edit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
