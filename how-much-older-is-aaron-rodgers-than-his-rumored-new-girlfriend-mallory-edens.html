The duo had been seen courtside together before as Rodgers has a minority stake in the team and Edens is the daughter of Wes Edens who is one of the Bucks’ primary owners.</p><p id=par-4_60>Reports that they were an item though were sent into overdrive when the celebrity-focused Instagram account,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeuxMoi</a>, noted that they shopped for a Christmas tree together. Edens also attended a Packers game decked out in the home team’s gear. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, they are dating but an insider told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that it’s not serious right now as they’re taking things slow.</p><p id=par-5_25>“It’s more than friends, but it’s casual. Nothing serious at all,” the source said. “He’s not looking to rush into anything. It’s low-key for now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aaron-Rodgers-and-Mallory-Edens-watching-a-game-between-the-Los-Angeles-Lakers-and-Milwaukee-Bucks-on-Dec.-02-2022-.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s their age difference?</h2><p id=par-6_60>Rodgers was born on Dec. 2, 1983, in Chico, California, to parents Edward Wesley Rodgers and Darla Leigh.&nbsp;He attended Butte Community College before transferring to&nbsp;the&nbsp;University of California, Berkeley and was selected by the Packers in the first round of the&nbsp;2005 NFL Draft.

There are no female GMs. There’s one team president who’s a woman in the NBA. There are no female head coaches–hopefully Becky Hammon gets a head coaching job soon. But other than that…there’s never been a female commissioner in any of the four major American sports leagues.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rodgers doesn’t want to rush things the way he did in the past</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/L-Aaron-Rodgers-looking-on-prior-to-a-game-against-the-Detroit-Lions-R-Shaliene-Woodley-looking-down-at-Paris-Fashion-Week.jpg><p id=par-9_45>People’s source who spoke about their relationship also claimed that the Green Bay signal-caller doesn’t want to rush things like he did in one of his previous relationships telling the publication: “He’s not going to do something as quick as Shailene [Woodley].

But after a few makeups and breakups, they decided to <a href=#>end things</a> for good in April 2022.
