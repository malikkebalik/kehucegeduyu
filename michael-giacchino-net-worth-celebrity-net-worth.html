He is of Italian descent on both his mother's and father's sides, and has a younger brother named Anthony who is an Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker. Giacchino began experimenting with filmmaking when he was 10, creating stop-motion animated films and soundtracks in his basement. As a teen, he went to Holy Cross High School in Delran Township, New Jersey, graduating in 1986. There, his art teacher recommended that he apply to New York City's School of Visual Arts for his higher education. After visiting the school with his parents, Giacchino applied, and was ultimately accepted. At SVA, he majored in film production with a minor in history; as a senior, he landed a six-month internship at Universal Pictures. Giacchino graduated with his BFA in 1990, and went on to take classes at the Juilliard School and UCLA.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings-in-video-games><strong>Career Beginnings in Video Games</strong></h2><p>Following the conclusion of his internship at Universal, Giacchino was hired by the company. From there, he eventually moved to Disney, where he worked in publicity. In that position, Giacchino interacted with a myriad of film personnel who gave him valuable connections. As a result, he landed a producer job at the video game developer Disney Interactive Studios. Giacchino went on to compose numerous video game scores for the company; his early credits included the Sega Genesis game "Gargoyles" and the SNES game "Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow." He later had his first major composition for the DreamWorks video game adaptation of the 1997 film "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." Notably, the game was among the first PlayStation titles to feature a live orchestral score. Following this, Giacchino composed the score for the 1998 video game adaptation of the film "Small Soldiers."</p><h2 id=film-scoring><strong>Film Scoring</strong></h2><p>Giacchino had his first major film score in 2004 with the Pixar animated superhero film "The Incredibles." In a departure from previous Pixar scores, which had all been composed by <a href=# title="Randy Newman Net Worth">Randy Newman</a> or Thomas Newman, Giacchino's score featured a uniquely peppy jazz orchestral style.

Two years later, he scored Pixar's "Up," this time winning the Academy Award.
