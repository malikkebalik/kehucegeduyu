But being a part of the franchise required some sacrifices to be made. In an interview with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Time Out</a>, the actor revealed how he had to he skip university to do the film.</p><p id=par-4_63>“It went so far over schedule, I couldn’t go,” Pattinson said. “It was supposed to be four months, but it ended up being ten or 11. I’d turn up set every day but not work for weeks at a time [because he wasn’t needed for filming]. I was 17 and I was the only person who wasn’t in school. I’d just hang about.”</p><p id=par-5_47>But one of the reasons Pattinson even ended up in the mega-franchise was because of <a href=#>a Reese Witherspoon movie</a>. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a>, Pattinson shared that he was originally cast in the movie Vanity Fair, playing Witherspoon’s son. However, he was later removed from the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_26>“My first job for when I was 15 or 16 is I was Reese Witherspoon’s son in Vanity Fair, which I was cut from,” Pattinson said.</p><p id=par-7_20>But fortunately for Pattinson, the casting director felt so guilty about the situation she offered him Cedric to make amends.</p><p id=par-8_56>“I went to the screening, and no one had informed me that I was cut. But the casting director Mary Selway, she felt so guilty that no one had informed me, that she basically gave me a first run at the Harry Potter. So, I was quite glad I got cut in the end,” he shared.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-robert-pattinson-hated-cedric-in-harry-potter>Why Robert Pattinson hated Cedric in ‘Harry Potter’</h2><p id=par-9_35>Pattinson once admitted he wasn’t too fond of the character that helped further his career. According to Robert Pattinson: The Unauthorized Biography, <a href=#>The Batman actor</a> couldn’t help air his grievances with Cedric to the public.</p><p id=par-10_17>“I hate him,” Pattinson once said bluntly. “I used to hate everybody like Cedric at my school.”</p><p id=par-11_13>He later elaborated further on what exactly separated him from his on-screen character.</p><p id=par-12_40>“I was never a leader and the idea of my being made head boy would have been a complete joke. I wasn’t involved in much at school, and I was never picked for any of the teams,” he later revealed.</p><p id=par-13_31>To Pattinson, the description of who Cedric was in the book also made it a challenge playing the handsome wizard. This proved to be off-putting to the star for several reasons.</p><p id=par-14_80>“This is quite difficult,” Pattinson said. “In the book, and also in my [character’s] first introduction in the script, it’s like, ‘an absurdly handsome 17-year old,’ and it kind of puts you off a little bit, when you’re trying to act, and you’re [also] trying to get good angles to look good-looking and stuff. It’s really stupid; you’d think I’m really egotistical. But I think that’s the most daunting part about it – it’s much scarier than meeting Lord Voldemort.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-pattinson-once-revealed-that-he-was-nothing-like-edward-cullen>Robert Pattinson once revealed that he was nothing like Edward Cullen</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_36>Another character that Pattinson once felt he was completely at odds with was <a href=#>Twilight’s Edward Cullen</a>. Although most might associate him with that character, Pattinson told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Idiva</a> that he and Cullen couldn’t be any more different.</p><p id=par-16_32>“Edward is a manic depressive character and I’m not like that at all. The only thing I have in common with him is that I drive like a maniac too,” Pattinson quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FsK7Eq6tmqJGpwaq60qilZp6fqrulec%2BlmLKhnpx6pLHDq6CcZZiWv7PFjKmmrayVp3qttdOto55loKrBtbXNoGWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chef-dave-describes-below-deck-as-a-setup-for-failure-it-broke-me.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chef Dave Describes 'Below Deck' as a Setup for Failure 'It Broke Me'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-gooch-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Gooch Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
