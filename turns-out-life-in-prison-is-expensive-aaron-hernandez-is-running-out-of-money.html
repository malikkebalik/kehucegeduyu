Ward could make more than $5 million in the case. Hernandez has been prevented from selling his 2005 Hummer and keeping the money by the court. Likewise, Hernandez's $1.3 million house in North Attleboro cannot be sold without the court being notified.</p><p>Ward's lawyer, Douglas Sheff, said that the goal now is to find out all about Hernandez's assets. Sheff believes that if Hernandez has someone working trying to sell his vehicle&nbsp;–&nbsp;it showed up in a lot in Wrentham, near Boston&nbsp;–&nbsp;there could be a lot of other moving pieces happening, too. Finding out exactly how much Hernandez has left is the next step, but if Hernandez's attorney is to be believed, it's not much.</p><p>Hernandez money woes probably won't end anytime soon, either. He pleaded not guilty to a witness intimidation charge related to a 2012 double murder he's also charged with, where he allegedly shot and killed two men in a car over a spilled drink in a bar.</p><p>That 2012 double murder case is still pending; this recent non-guilty plead relates to Hernandez allegedly shooting his friend Alexander Bradley in 2013 a night after Bradley made a remark about the double killings in Boston. Bradley says the shooting resulted in the loss of his right eye.</p><p>So in case you were wondering, yes, lawyers are expensive. Particularly if you need an entire army of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2sq6ajYrmqssRmp6uho6S7brHXqZynq5mrsm6twKump2WYmr%2Bvrc2dnLNloqq7r7XNoGSmp56axnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-the-couples-from-the-show-perfect-match-still-together.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are the Couples From the Show Perfect Match Still Together?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theresa-nist-s-wedding-dress-is-not-what-she-envisioned.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Theresa Nist's Wedding Dress Is 'Not' What She 'Envisioned'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
