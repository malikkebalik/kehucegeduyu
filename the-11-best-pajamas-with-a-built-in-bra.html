More often than not, it’s easier to rotate in some <a href=# class=T3D>camis with shelf bras</a> or to simply sleep in a bra rather than trying to find an actual pajama set or cute nightgown with support. Fortunately, I found several <a href=# class=T3D>versatile pajama sets</a> that offer a nice range of structure, from a sleep chemise with a thin shelf bra to a lounge-worthy T-shirt and shorts set with a hidden bra included.</p><h2>Which Level Of Support Is Right For Me?</h2><p>In terms of support, a shelf bra will offer the least amount of support, but it’s also the most likely to be comfortable since you only have a thin layer of fabric and an elastic band to adjust. Some padded sets can be almost as comfortable as a shelf bra if their pads are lightweight and flexible (like a low-impact sports bra), but you’ll also find sets with stiffer molded cups that offer more shaping. The most supportive option is the underwire, but most people don’t find them very comfortable for sleep — so they’ll usually be found on nightgowns designed for special occasions when you want to feel extra fancy.</p><p>Whatever level of chest support you're after, there's a sleepwear solution for you below. There are matching sets, including buttery soft camisoles and T-shirt pairs. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to find good flannel or <a href=# class=T3D>silk pajama sets </a>with chest support, so you won’t find those here — but, if you want cute separates for a range of climates, you can also find cooling camisoles and thermal tees with shelf bras listed. These 11 sleep-worthy options have different types of built-in bras that are all comfy, cozy, and supportive.</p><h2>Shop The Best Pajamas With A Built-In Bra</h2><p>In a hurry?

Subtle shirring adds a delicate accent, and the moisture-wicking polyester blended fabric has four-way stretch for comfort.

I've been searching for a top like this to sleep in for FOREVER. I wore this last night and it was very comfortable., exactly what I was looking for. I can't stand wearing a bra to bed but don't necessarily like walking around without one. This top is freaking genius. I wish every shirt had these built-ins!”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small – 1X</li><li>Available colors: 9</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">3</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Lace-Trimmed Cami Pajama Set With A Lightweight Bra</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>cami and shorts set</a> has a soft shelf bra that’s lightly supportive. The racerback tank won’t slide off your shoulders or get twisted overnight, and the shorts have a wider elastic waistband that stays securely in place. Both pieces are made from a soft and lightweight viscose blend, trimmed in lace for a touch of pretty to go with all that comfy. Despite its delicate details, this low-maintenance set is still safe to go in the washing machine and dryer.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“These are incredibly soft and light. Love wearing these now that it’s getting hot. It’s so difficult to find pajamas with support without being a nursing pajama and I finally found one. [...] I just bought another set because I love them so much.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small – X-Large</li><li>Available colors: 5</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">4</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Sleek Nightgown With A Built-In Bra</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>comfy tank nightgown</a> has a lightweight shelf bra plus removable cups (similar to what you’d find in a swimsuit) for easy-to-doze-off-in shaping with support. The modal and spandex blend is soft and stretchy, and available in both a wide strap and adjustable spaghetti strap style. There are so many colors to pick from — everything from subtle neutrals to rich jewel tones.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“I really love this night dress, enough to buy a second in another color. It feels young and cute without being lingerie. The colors are rich and hold up to washing. And it has just the right amount of chest support for a bustier figure.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: X-Small – 5X-Large</li><li>Available colors and styles: 48</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">5</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A T-Shirt Pajama Set With A Hidden Padded Bra</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>T-shirt pajama set</a> actually has wireless push-up bra cups for additional shaping. The fabric is a blend of silky smooth modal and breathable cotton, which feels amazing against your skin. The shorts won’t dig or come untied thanks to an elastic waist, and they even have pockets. While this pick doesn’t have a ton of reviews, shoppers did note that the set runs small — so you’ll want to size up for a roomier fit. However, the butter-soft material promises an easy wear once you dial in your correct size. Also, you can buy just the<a href=# rel=noreferrer> T-shirt with a built-in bra</a> if you're interested in pairing it with some of your own sleep shorts.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer:</strong> “I love this pajama set! I am about a size 8 and ordered the brown in size XL. It is very soft and fits perfectly. The shelf bra gives just enough support when I am up and around in the morning. [...] If you are closer to a size 10, you may want to go up a size as it fits nicely but might be a little snug if you are a bit larger.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: M – XX-Large</li><li>Available colors: 9</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">6</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Simple Cotton Chemise With Adjustable Straps</h2></p><p>Breathable and oh-so soft, there’s a reason why cotton is such a popular choice for pajamas. Simple yet elegant, this <a href=# rel=noreferrer>nightgown with shelf bra</a> is made of 92% organic cotton, with 8% elastane for just the right amount of stretch. The shelf bra comes with removable foam pads, so you can customize the amount of coverage you get — combined with the adjustable spaghetti straps, its so easy to achieve your ideal fit. With the bottom hem hitting just above the knee, the gown isn’t too long or too short — it’s just right.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“I’m so pleased with this spaghetti strap dress/nightgown with a bra shelf that I now own 5 of them. They are very well constructed, easy to launder, and amazingly comfortable. I wear them around the house and out in public as the fabric is not at all sheer (no need for a bra or a slip) and the length’s perfect.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: X-Small — 5X-Large</li><li>Available colors: 46</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">7</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Gorgeous Sheer Nightgown That’s Wildly Comfortable</h2></p><p>This <a href=# rel=noreferrer>gorgeous nightgown</a> gets its support from a high-stretch lining without the need for elastic bands or padded cups. The nylon lace is silky yet sturdy, with a sheer, floaty skirt that falls to the floor — critically, according to one satisfied shopper, it doesn’t bunch up in bed, either. By its delicate look, you’d expect this gown to be hand-wash only, but it’s even sturdy enough to toss in the laundry. There are eight lovely shades available, including royal blue, flamingo pink, and periwinkle.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: “</strong>I love this nightgown so much! [...] The material feels so nice against my skin and it doesn't ever twist around me to the point I feel totally bound up in it. It just kind of floats. And it is very lightweight. The lace over the bust is soft and has a nice stretch to it.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — 3X-Large Plus</li><li>Available colors: 7</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">8</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Wallet-Friendly Pajama Set With A Lacy Cami Top</h2></p><p>Featuring a cami top with a lacy trim and a pair of matching shorts, this <a href=# rel=noreferrer>pajama set</a> strikes the perfect balance between cute and casual. The bodice has a sheer lace band that hits right below the bust, defining the cups and offering the lightest amount of support. Meanwhile, the shorts have a high elastic waistband and a cheeky cut in the back, as well as lace side panels for an added touch of style. You can pick from neutral shades and vibrant jewel tones — or leopard print, if you’re feeling bold. At such a wallet-friendly price, you can even scoop up a few different options.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: “</strong>The set is very cute, well made, and looks great on. The lace panels on the sides of the shorts are a nice touch. The fabric is soft and comfortable, and the straps on the top are adjustable.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors and patterns: 19</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">9</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Lace-Trimmed Nightie With A Bra-Like Effect</h2></p><p>For the look of a bra that ditches the elastic and padding, this fan favorite <a href=# rel=noreferrer>babydoll nightie</a> is sewn with soft triangle cups trimmed in lace for a little bit of lingerie-inspired shaping. Two adjustable spaghetti straps ensure you get the right fit, and the hemline is long enough to feel comfortable wearing around the house. It pairs wonderfully beneath a robe on chillier days, or it can be worn all on its own.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“New favorite Jammie right here. It's a nice soft material, very comfortable. Not too thin, not too thick nor heavy. Fits well around the shoulders as the straps are adjustable, and well around the chest. All around a great product!!!”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small — XX-Large</li><li>Available colors: 21</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">10</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">A Cozy Thermal Tee That Can Be Paired With Any PJ Pant</h2></p><p>This long-sleeved <a href=# rel=noreferrer>T-shirt with a built-in bra</a> was built for the yoga mat, but that soft and breathable cotton blend with a thermal lining is just right for bed on chilly nights, too. The fabric shelf bra has sewn-in contour cups for medium support and shaping. Not to mention, it's safe to machine wash with a tumble dry — just one less thing you have to worry about. Pair with these best-selling <a href=# rel=noreferrer>cotton flannel pajama pants</a> for a toasty set that was made for snuggling up with a mug of tea or cocoa.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“Super comfy and the best part is that the built in bra wasn't very padded. I was able to wear it to sleep and nurse my baby and I would actually forget I have it on during the day. Aside from that functional and super comfy, it provides good support.”</p><ul><li>Available sizes: Small – Large</li><li>Available colors: 6</li></ul></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ GTB">11</h2><h2 class="i7p XE2">This Racerback Lingerie Nightgown With A Truly Supportive Bra</h2></p><p>This stunning <a href=# rel=noreferrer>sheer babydoll nightie</a> is made from silky mesh, with eyelash lace on the underwire cups, hem, and back panel.

Both shoulder straps are fully adjustable on either side, and the back band features a wide triple hook and eye closure. It also comes with a matching G-string to complete the look.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“Looks and fits just as nice as it does on the model. Good bust support as well.

This one has a sweetheart racer-style cut and wide lace straps, with soft, thin removable pads if you want less shaping. These bralettes aren't super supportive per several reviews – but if you want something that’s soft and stretchy above all else, you’ll find plenty to love. Pair it with both long pajama bottoms and shorts, or layer it beneath an unlined nightgown.</p><p><strong>According to a reviewer: </strong>“I bought this to wear around my home and to sleep in.
