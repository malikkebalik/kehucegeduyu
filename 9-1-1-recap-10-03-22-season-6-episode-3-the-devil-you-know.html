She was busy doing her chores. Helping her mother. She was being a kid. She didn’t realize at the time what kind of danger this world held for a children like her. She didn’t realize it until a little girl she played with had gone missing from her bed. Tanya’s mother went to go check on her one night and she couldn’t find. She wasn’t in her bed. She wasn’t in the house. She went over to Athena’s place to see if Tanya went over there to hang out with her friend and neither Athena nor her parents had seen Tanya. Tanya’s mother continued to look for her little girl and the whole community came out to help that night.</p><p>They searched for hours. Athena remembers her father grabbing his gun. He and the other men in her community went looking for Tanya and the search never yielded a body. All they ever found was one of Tanya’s barrettes in the woods. But everyone knew she was dead. They all eventually moved on. It was just Athena who couldn’t forget. Athena may have been young at the time yet she knew enough to realize that her friend was never going to be found and that’s what pushed her into becoming a cop. Now, she’s a decorated Sergeant in the LAPD. She has the means to investigate Tanya’s remains and she wasn’t doing so for some unknown reason.</p><p>Technically, Athena doesn’t have jurisdiction in Florida. She was a cop in a different state. This investigation into Tanya’s murder also involved her father as a chief suspect and so the local police told Athena to leave things to them. Only that usually doesn’t stop Athena. She goes running in spite of the danger. She always has and she always will. She just didn’t want to take on this case. It was so odd that her husband Bobby confronted her. He asked her why she wasn’t investigating and she told him because she was genuinely worried her father might have done it. Her father had arrived home late that night Tanya went missing.</p><p>Samuel Carter had claimed to have car trouble that might. He was covered in dirt. His clothes were all messed up and he smelled awful. Both his wife and his daughter bought his story. They knew that Samuel was usually well-kept person. He normally would never have been so disheveled and yet he was that night. They figured it had to be because of his car. But there were other reasons to suspect him for this crime. Athena has been a cop for over twenty years and she knows that killers often go back to the crime scene. It also would explain why her father joined the search party for Tanya.</p><p>Maybe he wanted to lead the search down a wrong path. It sure looked odd when Samuel decided to build an addition to his house literally a day after Tanya went missing and his excuse at the time was that his family needed something to help take their minds off of the missing Tanya. Samuel hadn’t built that addition in the years before because he would say he didn’t have the money. He only found the money once Tanya went missing. Athena became suspicious of that too. Athena spoke to the man who built that addition for her parents and Mr. Reggie Franklin Senior told her the story surrounding that addition. He also mentioned that it had been opened to the public during the construction.</p><p>Franklin’s DNA was also collected by the cops investigating the murder. He like every man in their community was a suspect until the killer was found and there had been a moment where Bobby had looked at the guy and it was clear he thought Franklin was the killer. But they didn’t have evidence. Athena still thought her father could be suspect. She needed proof either way and so she eventually she came around to investigating the murder. Both she and Bobby went over to Tanya’s house. The house was still in that family. The parents had passed away and it was just Tanya’s older sister Joanne that lived there now.</p><p>Joanne pulled a gun on Athena when she saw the couple sneaking around. She thought they were suspects and she hadn’t taken it well when she realized Samuel’s daughter was the one snooping on her property. She wanted to shoot Athena. Bobby grabbed the gun and he got it away from Joanne. He and Athena were then able to talk Joanne down and Joanne admitted to them a secret she’s been holding onto for over forty years. Joanne knew this whole time how Tanya’s barrette made it into the woods. It happened because Joanne snuck out of that house that night. She left from Tanya’s window and Tanya followed her.</p><p>Tanya followed her into the woods where there was a party. Tanya refused to leave. She wanted a sip of beer and eventually she disappeared from the party. Joanne thought she simply went back home. It wasn’t until she later went home that she found Tanya never made it back. Joanne had felt so bad that she allowed her parents to think Tanya was taken from her bed. She hadn’t wanted them to blame her for her sister going missing. But she told Athena and Bobby. The police later showed up because Joanne had called the cops when she thought someone was snooping on the property and they detained Athena because the lead detective realized she was investigating.</p><p>The detective questioned Athena. Athena was able to turn the tables and both she and the detective shared information. It turns out Tanya didn’t go into the concrete afterwards. She went in first, someone poured lye on her, and then the concrete was poured on top of her. Meaning Franklin lied, but why? Bobby was able to connect Franklin’s car to being there at that party that night. But Franklin wasn’t the only one with access to that car. His son Junior was around the same age as Joanne. He was there at that party. It turns out he offered to drive Tanya home that night when really he gave her beer and tried to make a pass at her. At a little girl.</p><p>Tanya was so spooked that she ran away from him. She tried shouting for her sister and Junior hunted her down and killed her. Junior also tried killing Joanne. He wanted to frame Joanne for her sister’s death all these years later, but Bobby found him. Bobby stopped him from killing Joanne and making it look like suicide. Junior ran off and Bobby was pursuing him. By this point, Bobby had already called to tell Athena what was happening. And so it was Athena who captured Junior in that orange grove. She arrested him and she said it took forty-five years but she got him in the end.</p><p>Franklin covered up for his son. He thought it was a one-time accident. It turns out Junior went on killing and the police could connect him to at least six other missing girls. And so both father and son were now looking at life.</p><p>And Joanne can finally be at peace.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnaWJ%2Bbn2Mq5ycmaBifnF5j2xka2pdqLKiv86nZG9llaW2tLvDnmRsZaSdsm6wxK%2BgpWWppMJut82ormg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./casting-jersey-shore-why-the-original-roommates-were-picked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Casting Jersey Shore: Why the original roommates were picked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-was-security-tightened-at-megan-thee-stallion-s-mom-s-grave.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why was security tightened at Megan Thee Stallions moms grave?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
