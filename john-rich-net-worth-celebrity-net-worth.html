John Rich began his career in 1992 as a member of the band Lonestar. With the group, he recorded the hit singles "No News" and "Come Cryin' to Me," the latter of which he also co-wrote. After leaving Lonestar in 1998, Rich embarked on a solo career, and in 2002 formed the country duo Big & Rich with <a href=#>Big Kenny</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>John Rich was born on January 7, 1974 in Amarillo, Texas to Judy and Baptist preacher Jim. As an adolescent, he attended Dickson County Senior High in Tennessee.</p><h2 id=lonestar><strong>Lonestar</strong></h2><p>After moving to Nashville, where he performed as a singer at the theme park Opryland USA, Rich met the country music group Texasee. He went on to join the group, which eventually changed its name to Lonestar. In addition to Rich, who served as the bass guitarist, the band's original lineup consisted of Richie McDonald, Michael Britt, Randy Rainwater, and Dean Sams. Lonestar soon signed to BNA Records and released its eponymous debut album in 1995. The album spawned the number-one country hit single "No News." Lonestar went on to release its second album, "Crazy Nights," in 1997. It was the band's last album to feature Rich, who co-wrote its hit single "Come Cryin' to Me."</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>Rich left Lonestar in 1998 and embarked on a solo career. His first album as a solo artist was "Rescue Me," which came out in late 2001. About five years later, Rich released "Underneath the Same Moon," which had actually been recorded in 1999. He followed that up with his most commercially successful album yet as a solo artist, "Son of a Preacher Man." The album peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and at number three on the Top Country Albums chart. Its most successful single was "Shuttin' Detroit Down." Rich went on to release the EPs "Rich Rocks" and "For the Kids" on the same day in 2011.</p><h2 id=big-amp-rich><strong>Big & Rich</strong></h2><p>In 1998, Rich befriended fellow country music singer Big Kenny. The two began collaborating, and in 2002 formed the country duo Big & Rich. Their first album, "Horse of a Different Color," came out in 2004 via Warner Bros. Nashville. It was a major hit, reaching number six on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top Country Albums chart, and spawning multiple hit singles including "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)" and "Holy Water." Big & Rich had further success with 2005's "Comin' to Your City" and 2007's "Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace." The latter album included the single "Lost in This Moment," which became the duo's first number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Big & Rich subsequently went on hiatus. They returned in 2012 with the album "Hillbilly Jedi." The duo next released "Gravity" in 2014 and "Did it for the Party" in 2017.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-211203 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/John-Rich.jpg alt="John Rich" width=594 height=425 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-211203 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick Breedon IV/Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-collaborations><strong>Other Collaborations</strong></h2><p>Both as a solo artist and with Big Kenny, Rich has collaborated with a myriad of artists over the years.
