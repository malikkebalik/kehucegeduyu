From matching tracksuits to <i>Clueless</i>-inspired minis, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>fashion trends of 1996</a> were so good that most, if not all, of them have made a comeback in 2016.</p><p>While <i>Clueless</i> technically came out in 1995, it wasn’t until the year after that the public got around to donning Cher-like attire. Mini skirts, knee-high socks, and cropped vests finally broke through the grunge scene. But no matter how hard Cher tried, '90s grunge had some serious staying power, as chokers, overalls, mini sunglasses, and scrunchies were among the hottest trends of the time. While some of these looked seemed destined for the trash bin (scrunchies, I’m looking at you), most of them have made it back into my daily wardrobe rotation thanks to the massive '90s revival that has taken over the 2016 sartorial scene.</p><p>If you are a fan of the '90s resurgence or just want to take a walk down memory lane, scroll down to see the 11 hottest trends from 20 years ago — all of which have exhibited tremendous longevity.</p><h3>1. Slip Dresses</h3><p>The slip dress was an evening-wear must in the '90s. Everyone from the Spice Girls to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kate Moss</a> rocked a slinky slip dress back in '96.</p><h3>2. Chokers</h3><p>If there is <i>one</i> accessory that defines the '90s and 1996 in particular, it has to be the choker. From beaded chokers via <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Liv Tyler</a> to layered gothic ones à la <i>The Craft</i>, the choker was the necklace of choice in '96.</p><h3>3. Overalls</h3><p>While we might like fitted overalls today, the teens of '96 preferred them big and baggy and styled with a backwards cap.</p><h3>4. Matchy Minis</h3><p>Pleated plaid minis à la <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cher Horowitz</a> as well as itsy bitsy denim ones were a mainstay 20 years ago.</p><h3>5. Track Pants</h3><p>The year 1996 knew how to do athleisure before it was even a thing. From Adidas track-pants and crop tops to slip dresses paired with sneakers, the year was responsible for making athletic-wear look cool.</p><h3>6. Gingham</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>PATRICK HERTZOG/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Sweet, simple, and always in style, gingham and plaids were just a few of the must-have prints in '96.</p><h3>7. One-Piece Swimsuits</h3><p>One-piece swimsuits were all the rage 20 years ago, and come to think of it, they are all the rage right now as well.</p><h3>8. Pigtails</h3><p>This was the hairstyle of choice in '96 — that is, if you weren't rocking an <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>awesome blow out</a> like Cher H.</p><h3>9. Headbands</h3><p>A headband atop your tresses was <i>so</i> 1996.</p><h3>10. Mini Sunglasses</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>KIM KULISH/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Round mini sunglasses were the go-to accessory that year.</p><h3>11. Sweatbands</h3><p>Whether paired with a mini dress or a tracksuit, every fashionista in '96 rocked a sweatband.</p><p>The moral of the story here is that 20 years ago, well, the fashion was surprisingly similar to today's.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyg5Jqam9lYWZ6tbTIp56sZaSdrrV51p6pnmWkp7KvsNhmaWllqZqus7%2BMmp6oZaCdvLW70g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aloe-blacc-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aloe Blacc Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./twitter-wrong-to-block-tweets-during-turkey-election.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Twitter wrong to block tweets during Turkey election</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
