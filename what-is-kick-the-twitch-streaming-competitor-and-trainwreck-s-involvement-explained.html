Among the new faces already jumping ship is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Trainwreck</strong></a>, the mega-popular Twitch streamer who has now declared himself a diehard Kicker (we just made that up).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Exactly what makes this app so appealing comes down to its features and, more importantly, its monetary compensation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-kick-and-why-has-trainwreck-left-twitch-for-it data-injectable=false>What is Kick and why has Trainwreck left Twitch for it?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Loading… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/syuaF7LQgt</a></p>— Kick.com (@KickStreaming) <a href=#>December 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>On the surface, Kick’s interface looks almost identical to Twitch’s, but the real magic happens behind the scenes, at least according to Trainwreck, whose real name is Tyler Niknam.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>On Dec. 3 Kick launched its beta version, and on the heels of that launch was the news that popular Twitch streamer, Trainwreck, was leaving the Amazon-owned service and taking with him his 2.1 million followers. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to him</a>, Kick blows Twitch out of the water with it’s 95-5 subscriber revenue split. Twitch’s revenue split is 50-50 and YouTube’s is 70-30.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Additonally, Kick offers same-day payout for content creators and 100 percent of any tips they receive. Those numbers are huge in comparison to Twitch. If they hold true then it’s only a matter of time before more creators like Trainwreck begin jumping ship. He broke down the bigger picture for his fans and fellow content creators in a lengthy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TwitLonger</a> post, saying:</p><p>“I choose to work with Kick because their investors are willing to listen to creator input to make their platform better. Kick understands that a successful platform starts with a successful streamer. I’ve worked with their team already to create these benefits that no other platform has. These features will roll out in the near future:</p><p>– Everyone gets a sub button. 95%-5% subscriber split with 95% of all subscriber income going to the streamer.</p><p>– 100% of all tips made on Kick, called “kicks”, will go to the streamer. Same day withdrawal.</p><p>– An innovative new exclusive creator program that will pay our partners for their stream’s success. This program works like no partner program before. You won’t have to rely on your subscriber count alone every month. You’ll get a steady income based on hours watched and total viewers you stream to with an option to be paid out on the same day.</p><p>– A TOS designed to be fair to streamers with clear rules on what’s okay and not okay. No ambiguous bans. Kick’s current TOS will be completely updated. The new TOS will include rules governing ethical gambling. Fill balances must be disclosed. No wager locked giveaways, no code locked giveaways, and no lying to audiences regarding the reality of gambling’s losing nature.</p><p>– Plus many more features I will share on my next update via Twitter.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>As of this writing, Kick has not officially confirmed Trainwreck’s facts and figures. It is currently busy “fixing bugs and dealing with the surge in traffic,” according to its official Twitter account. Whether or not the streaming service can outlast the popularity Trainwreck’s spotlight shined on it is another question entirely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArWSiq12gtqS3jK2fnmWkrLa1r8dmqq2qlZa6qrrGZpqopaCawarAzqtkmqaUYsGzrcinrqudk6DAbrXNr6alrpWisq%2FAjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-mangle-s-real-name.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Mangles real name?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-clancy-made-a-seriously-insane-amount-of-money-writing-books.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Clancy Made A Seriously INSANE Amount Of Money Writing Books</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
