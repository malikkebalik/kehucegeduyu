The person who ends up with the most points deducted at the end of the episode has to take a punishment created by the others. Because these are usually super brutal, the jokers will pretty much and do whatever it takes to avoid losing points — and the results are hilarious.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_45>The show premiered in 2011 and was an instant hit, drawing good ratings and a rare 100% rating on <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a>. “[It’s] possibly the funniest, most ridiculous show I’ve seen in years, Linda Stasi of <a href=#>The New York Post</a> wrote in a season one review.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Impractical Jokers’ has featured some really wild punishments</h2><p id=par-5_42>And the punishments on Impractical Jokers have only gotten worse over time. They range from forcing jokers to face their fears and eat gross foods to having them give awkward speeches in front of large crowds and strip down in public.</p><p id=par-6_19>Lots of viewers would argue that this is the best part of the show, but the jokers say otherwise.</p><p id=par-7_48>“People enjoy our misery so much, but honestly on those days, the days that you know that you’re the one getting it,&nbsp;it’s actually not a fun day for the person that’s there,” Vulcano said in a previous interview with <a href=#>Forbes</a>. “Everybody else is cool, the other three guys.”</p><p id=par-8_42>“When someone else is getting punished you show up, you eat some lunch, you sit back because you’re not going to do anything. But when you’re the one that has to go, that whole day is a very miserable experience,” Vulcano added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Danica McKellar was once a part of a punishment on ‘Impractical Jokers’</h2><p id=par-9_59>McKellar was a part of a 2015 episode, when the jokers called her in to help punish Murr, who had lost a challenge. Murr was greased up, dressed in a thong, and told that he was going to participate in a bodybuilding competition. But his friends had actually arranged for him to interview McKellar, who was Murr’s childhood crush.</p><p id=par-10_45>After being led into a room with McKellar — who played Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years (1988 to 1993) — Murr’s face immediately turned red with embarrassment. Flustered, he stumbled and struggled to get through the questions as McKellar looked on in apparent disgust.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_39>“That was mortifying. Physically embarrassing,” Murr said of the experience in a later interview with <a href=#>Channel Guide magazine</a>. “Absolutely destroyed my ego, you know? I had no game whatsoever, and she looked so beautiful, and I looked so not.”</p><p id=par-12_6>Yeah, not cool, guys.
