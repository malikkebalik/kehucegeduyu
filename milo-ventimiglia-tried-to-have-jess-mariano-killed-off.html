If Ventimiglia had it his way, fans would be mourning his death rather than shipping him with Rory Gilmore.</p><p>Published on March 29, 2021</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_72>Many&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;fans are dedicated to the idea of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rory Gilmore</a>&nbsp;ending up with her high school beau,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jess Mariano</a>. Team Jess fans have spent years debating the merits of the relationship and whether they would be better together as adults. If Milo Ventimiglia, the actor who portrayed Jess on the show, had his way, there would be no discussion. He pitched the idea of killing off the character after his initial exit from the series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-milo-ventimiglia-appeared-in-37-episodes-of-the-original-gilmore-girls>Milo Ventimiglia appeared in 37 episodes of the original&nbsp;Gilmore Girls</h2><p id=par-2_51>In season 1 of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, Rory was happily involved with Dean Forrester. Their romance took fans through season 1 and most of season 2. Jess turned up in season 2 as Luke Danes’ troubled nephew. While Jess hated almost everyone and everything in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stars Hollow</a>, he took a liking to Rory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Milo-Ventimiglia-young-1.jpg><p id=par-3_42>Rory, drawn to his brooding nature and love of reading, eventually cheated on Dean with Jess. By season 3, the two were a couple, but the romance was short-lived. Ventimiglia and his character departed the series at the end of season 3.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_65>Ventimiglia’s departure from the show wasn’t for good, though. He showed up throughout seasons 4, 5, and 6 in one-off scenes. His final appearance came in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“The Real Paul Anka,”</a>&nbsp;the 18th episode of season 6. In total, Jess appeared in 37 episodes of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. Ventimiglia later reprised his role in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&nbsp;in 2016. He appeared in 2 of the special’s four episodes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-milo-ventimiglia-wanted-writers-to-kill-off-jess-mariano>Milo Ventimiglia wanted writers to kill off Jess Mariano</h2><p id=par-5_64>Ventimiglia was grateful for his time on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, but he hoped for a grislier ending for his character. In 2016, Ventimiglia told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online&nbsp;</a>that he pitched Jess’s death to the showrunners. He told the publication, “[I wanted to] get him hit by a bus, a knife in the side of the neck, something bad. I don’t know–guess I thought it would be kind of cool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Milo-Ventimiglia.jpg><p id=par-6_63>Writers decided to go with something a bit less extreme. At the end of season 3, Jess encounters his father, Jimmy Mariano, and embarks on a cross-country trek to reunite with him after Luke kicks him out. The trip was supposed to serve as a backdoor pilot to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a spinoff series</a>. The spinoff never got off the ground due to the cost of filming.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thankfully-no-one-went-for-the-idea-of-killing-off-jess>Thankfully, no one went for the idea of killing off Jess</h2><p id=par-7_64>Jess might have been obnoxious, abrasive, and a little self-involved, but hatred for the character never ran deep.&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;showrunner&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Sherman-Palladino</a>&nbsp;and her partner, Dan Palladino, never went for the idea of killing off the character. They loved him so much that they even made room for him in the 2016 revival,&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, and changed the character up quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Luke-and-Jess.jpg><p id=par-8_23>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’: Milo Ventimiglia Has No Idea Who the Father of Rory’s Baby Is, but Matt Czuchry Does</a></p><p id=par-9_62>Jess, who was an angsty team, appeared to grow into a responsible and mature adult by the time the revival happened. While Sherman-Palladino decided not to fill in that backstory, it is clear that Jess’ depiction in the reboot was supposed to be a bit of redemption. What would come of him if Netflix were to announce&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a second revival</a>&nbsp;is anyone’s guess, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0qrjMqKmeZZeev62%2FjKagpaddq7KvwMimoKCkmZZ6tb7InptmrJ9itaLCxGahnqujYrqivsiapahlm565rbHDZqafnl6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-mets-are-paying-88-million-for-their-pitchers-to-play-for-other-teams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Mets Are Paying $88 Million For Their Pitchers To Play For Other Teams</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katherine-kranz-author-at-we-got-this-covered.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katherine Kranz, Author at We Got This Covered</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
