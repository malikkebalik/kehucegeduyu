The period brought fans 10 Things I Hate About You, She’s All That, and various other classics. <a href=#>She’s All That</a>, seemed like a bit of a sleeper flick when it was released. It’s only grown in popularity over the years, but a little mystery about Simon Boggs remains.</p><h2>Kieran Culkin portrayed Simon Boggs &nbsp;in She’s All That &nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_48>Kieran Culkin took on the role of Simon Boggs in She’s All That way back in 1999. Simon was the younger sibling of Laney Boggs, portrayed by Rachael Leigh Cook. Simon, unlikely his sister, was interested in befriending Zack Siler, played by <a href=#>Freddie Prinz. Jr.,</a> and gaining popularity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Keiran-Culkin.jpg><p id=par-3_70>Culkin was 17 when he took on the role of Simon. While Simon’s age is never mentioned, he’s assumed to be a few years younger than Laney. Laney and Zack are both high school seniors when the flick opens. &nbsp;After She’s All That, Culkin appeared in a variety of television and movie projects. Most recently, he reprised his role as Matty Banks in <a href=#>Father of the Bride Part 3 (ish).</a></p><h2>The movie never explains Simon’s hearing aids</h2><p id=par-4_47><a href=#>She’s All That</a> seems to be consistently on television. It was a moderate success when it was produced but seems to have gained something of a cult following in the years since. Fans of the movie have one serious question; why were Simon’s hearing aids never mentioned?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_46>During the majority of the flick, Simon was seen wearing dual hearing aids, which would indicate he was hard of hearing. Noone in the film, however, mentions it. Fans walk away from the movie never knowing if Simon is part of the Deaf community or not.</p><h2>Keiran Culkin has absolutely no idea why Simon wore hearing aids, either</h2><p id=par-6_71>Fans aren’t the only ones who don’t know why Simon wore hearing aids. Their existence was never explained to the actors in the film, either. According to <a href=#>CinemaBlend</a>, Culkin claims his friends and fans have quizzed him about the hearing aids in the past, but, unfortunately, he has no insider information. He has no idea why his character was wearing them or why the production team decided not to mention them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rachael-Leigh-Cook-and-Jay-Leno.jpg><p id=par-7_70>So, there is no backstory. Since Culkin, himself, doesn’t know why his character used hearing aids, it seems that the mystery will stay a mystery. It doesn’t look like Culkin will be coming back to the movie’s reboot to clear things up, either. While Cook has signed on to <a href=#>He’s All That</a>, the reboot of the iconic teen movie, Culkin has yet to announce if he’ll reprise his role. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BbrnYrKueqqlis7O7zGaqoZ2jYq6tuIytn5qsXay2rbiMpaCknZyueq%2Bx1Z6pZpqVYsCwuNWem2egpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ahmad-rashad-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ahmad Rashad Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./watch-walking-dead-star-norman-reedus-is-not-afraid-to-play-daryl-gay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch: Walking Dead Star Norman Reedus is Not Afraid to Play Daryl Gay</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
