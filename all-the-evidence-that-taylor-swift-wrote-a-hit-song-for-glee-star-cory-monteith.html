In fact, fans think the <a href=#>Eras Tour star</a> wrote a hit song about their brief relationship. Here’s all the evidence that <a href=#>Swift wrote a single</a> from her 2010 album Speak Now for Monteith.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-glee-star-cory-monteith-said-he-and-taylor-swift-were-just-friends>‘Glee’ star Cory Monteith said he and Taylor Swift were ‘just friends’</h2><p id=par-2_53>In the spring of 2010, Taylor Swift and Cory Monteith were rumored to be dating after they were photographed together at a Grammys party. They also reportedly spent time together at a Hollywood bowling alley. Their short-lived romance would’ve occurred after <a href=#>John Mayer broke Swift’s heart</a> but before her <a href=#>relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal</a>.</p><p id=par-3_50>In a May 2010 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the host asked Monteith about the dating rumors. “No, we’re just friends,” he replied. “I don’t know where the time is to date these days.” When Degeneres insisted he and Swift would make a “cute couple,” Monteith responded, “She’s lovely.”</p><p id=par-4_23>One day after the <a href=#>Glee star’s tragic death</a> in 2013, Swift tweeted, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taste of Country</a>, “Speechless. And for the worst reason.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-taylor-swift-may-have-written-the-song-mine-about-her-relationship-with-cory-monteith>Taylor Swift may have written the song ‘Mine’ about her relationship with Cory Monteith</h2><p id=par-5_50>Fans think the song “Mine” from Taylor Swift’s 2010 album Speak Now is about Cory Monteith. The pop star said she wrote all her songs, making it possible that the love song “Mine” was autobiographical. The track was released a few months after <a href=#>Swift’s rumored romance</a> with the Glee star.</p><p id=par-6_120>The singer has said “Mine” is about her tendency to run from love. “It’s been sort of a recent tendency, and I think it’s because, for me, every really direct example of love that I’ve had in front of me has ended in goodbye and ended in break-ups and things like that,” Swift explained per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Songfacts</a>. “So I think I’ve developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out because I’m never ever going to go past hoping that love works out.”</p><p id=par-7_14>Interestingly, <a href=#>actor Naya Rivera</a> performed a cover of “Mine” in Season 4 of Glee.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-fans-think-the-singer-definitely-wrote-mine-for-the-glee-star>Fans think the singer definitely wrote ‘Mine’’’ for the ‘Glee’ star</h2><p id=par-8_17>Taylor Swift fans discussed the theory that she wrote “Mine” for Cory Monteith in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> thread.</p><p id=par-9_124>“So I’m a huge Gleek as well as a Swiftie, and I was creeping the instagram led by Cory Monteith’s mom tonight, and I noticed a while ago in her story (highlights) she shared a picture of Taylor & Cory with the song Mine playing,” wrote one fan. “I know it’s been rumoured Mine was about Cory but never confirmed. I remember reading that Taylor said Mine was about a guy she briefly dated but wasn’t ready to get into a relationship with because she had just got out of one (with John Mayer), but she wrote it imagining what their relationship would have been like. Because of the timing, their photos, and Cory’s interview on Ellen, everyone guessed the song was about Cory.”</p><p id=par-10_48>The fan added that Swift revealed the song’s subject texted her after he heard it, recognizing the lyrics were about him. “Given I feel Cory would share with his mom if this song was about him – is this kinda confirmation Mine was about him?” the fan wondered.</p><p id=par-11_25>Another fan wrote, “I think you’re right. She started hanging out with Cory after <a href=#>her and John broke up</a> and wasn’t ready for another relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyt7XDnqWcnV2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8Fuw9Goq55lmJ7Bbr%2FOp55mn5yasm6%2F05qpZpufp8Zuuc6nq56hpJ17qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cris-abrego-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cris Abrego Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-did-gojo-say-to-geto-at-the-end-of-jujutsu-kaisen-0.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What did Gojo say to Geto at the end of Jujutsu Kaisen 0?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
