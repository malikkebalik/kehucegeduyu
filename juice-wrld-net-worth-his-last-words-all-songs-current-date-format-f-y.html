Higgins’ mother was very religious and conservative and did not let him listen to hip hop.</p><p>He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, however, being introduced to artists including Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic! at the Disco through video games such as Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and Guitar Hero.</p><p>Higgins was a heavy drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade and using Percocet and Xanax in 2013.</p><p>Higgins also smoked cigarettes briefly before quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues.</p><p>He learned to play the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace, who later began paying for lessons.</p><p>He then took up the guitar and drums while also playing the trumpet for band class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to SoundCloud which he recorded on his smartphone.

One of those questions is what were the rapper’s <strong>last words?</strong></p><p>Juice WRLD’s last known words, spoken just nine days before his tragic overdose, were a message to his fans:<strong> “I love ya’ll more than life itself.”</strong> While we know that those weren’t his very last words, they are the last words on record that act as a comfort to his fans.</p><p>Many believe that the hip hop legend predicted his death and left ‘clues’ in his music. In the song ‘Legends’ he raps “What’s the 27 Club? We ain’t making it past twenty-one.”</p><p>The week before his death, he tweeted “<strong>This life is yours do what you want to do, do great things and change the world don’t let no one tell you SH*T.. and you’ll be bigger than “juice wrld” will ever be, and he’s going down as a legend</strong>.”</p><h2><strong>Juice Wrld Popular Songs and Album</strong></h2><p>American recording artist Juice Wrld released four studio albums, nine extended plays, two mixtapes, <strong>34 singles</strong> (including four as featured artists), and one promotional single, including posthumous releases.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how Juice Wrld keep releasing new song even after he is dead?</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow external sponsored noopener" data-wpel-link=external>DOWNLOAD MP3 HERE</a></strong></p><p>The answer is, those are the songs and albums he wrote before he died.
