The series finale is now streaming on Apple TV, which means fans will have to go through the emotional process of saying goodbye to their favorite characters. The good news is that the finale gives you plenty of time to do, with a staggering runtime of one hour and 15 minutes, and it’s fitting that the last Ted Lasso episode also be the longest.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>Those who want more, however, may be wondering if the sitcom has a post-credits scene after the main story has wrapped. Ted Lasso is not opposed to leaving fans with a cliffhanger, as evidenced by the reveal that Nate (Nick Mohammed) betrayed Ted (Jason Sudeikis) in the season 2 finale. Could there be a glimpse of a future we never get to see? Perhaps even a hint of a spin-off show?</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, there are no extras after the screen cuts to black. There is no post-credits scene in the Ted Lasso series finale, which makes sense given the emphasis that the creators have placed upon it being the end of the story. Showrunner Bill Lawrence <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he always intended for the sitcom to have a three-act structure that would play out over a trio of seasons.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>“When we started, we plotted out everybody’s beginning, middle and end of a three-season arc,” the Scrubs creator stated. “This story is going to be over next year, regardless, even if the show finds another story to tell and goes on.”</p><h2 id=h-will-ted-lasso-come-back-for-season-4 data-injectable=false>Will Ted Lasso come back for season 4?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-is-ted-lasso-about.jpg><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Lawrence left the door open for his fellow creatives to expand the show, but producers/stars Brett Goldstein and Sudeikis have followed his lead. Goldstein <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Sunday Times</a> that the show is still “planned as three,” and that the staff is “writing it like that” ahead of the final season.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>The notion of including a post-credits scene, after months of asserting that season 3 is the end, is a bit silly. It would chip away at the emotional impact of the final scene, and get fans inquiring about spin-offs that currently have no plans to be realized. It’s also worth noting that Ted Lasso has taken a critical lashing this time out, with many citing the overlong runtime and expanding roster as damaging to the show’s original appeal.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes score</a> bears this out. In comparison to the first two seasons, which earned a critics score of 98 percent and 92 percent respectively, the last season has dipped to 81 percent. Regardless of how one feels about the last season, the general consensus is that Ted Lasso is not going out on top, so the push for a spin-off or a post-credits hint at the future show, is not what it would’ve been even one year ago.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Ted Lasso may be over, but the cast still has some fun ideas about what each of their characters would get up to if they got their own spin-off. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Beast revealed</a> these hypothetical offshoots after the finale aired, and they will go a long way in helping fans say goodbye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZK2dlGK5or%2FSqGShmaaaeqJ5z6iqrWWTp7KltdOsZKyblaOycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ilan-hall-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ilan Hall Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./an-erotic-thriller-that-flipped-the-script-on-salacious-stories-reaches-a-satisfying-climax-on-netfl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>An erotic thriller that flipped the script on salacious stories reaches a satisfying climax on Netfl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
