The <a href=#>Todd Phillips</a> directed, <a href=#>Joaquin Phoenix</a> starring origin story has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide and is well on its way towards becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. This is excellent news for Phillips and Phoenix, as both of them took back-end points on the project in exchange for smaller salaries when Warner Brothers started to get cold feet about making the film.</p><p>Joker stands to make about $500 million from the global theatrical, streaming and TV deals wrap up. The more Joker&nbsp;makes, the more Phoenix and Phillips will make. This back-end bounty is familiar territory for Phillips. For the first Hangover movie, he gave up his $6.5 million directing salary in exchange for 16% of the film's gross. He ended up making $75 million for the first film and another $75 million for the two sequels. We don't know how much of the backend Phillips and Phoenix got. Assuming they got between 5% and 10% of the profit points each, they stand to make $25 million to $50 million for Joker.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289889 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184084247.jpg alt width=900 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289889 class=wp-caption-text>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images</p><p>It is safe to assume that Phillips and Phoenix's Joker deals were similar to <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a>' for Deadpool. He took home a relatively paltry $2 million. His payday ultimately increased nearly 10-fold thanks to a lucrative share of the back-end points. The first Deadpool cost just $58 million to make and went on to gross $780 million. He earned enough money in 2017, roughly $22 million, to be one of the 20 highest-paid actors on the planet for that year. His earnings for Deadpool 2 have not been officially confirmed but he likely earned a minimum of $20 million for the second installment. With backend points, his earnings for the second movie, which earned $785 million globally, might ultimately top $30-40 million</p><p>Phillips and Phoenix are already signed up for the sequel to Joker. &nbsp;That was pretty much signed, sealed, and delivered after the film's massive $96.2 million opening weekend. Joker is the fourth DC universe movie to cross $1 billion in gross box office receipts. Joker stands to make more profits than the other three – Aquaman, The Dark Night Rises, and The Dark Night –&nbsp;because its $60 million budget is far less than the other films.</p><p>Phillips is estimated to make close to $100 million for the film when all is said and done. He has a part of the adjusted gross of the film. He's also been given the rights by Warner Brothers to not only film the <i>Joker sequel</i>&nbsp;but to develop at least one more DC character's origin story. We'd love to see him explore the origin story of another DC villain – Lex Luthor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDAzp2bZqiYnrmttc%2BsZJqmlGK3sK3QrqCnZaCdvKa6yLFkrKyRo7FuwM5mnJqqnmK6or%2FSoq2eZZqkuKa%2BjKmYspyRrsBuwMeapaSrXam8brjUnKmarJmrsm6uwJyiZp2emXqlscClZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-maigan-the-blue-ajah-sitter-in-the-wheel-of-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Maigan, the Blue Ajah Sitter, in The Wheel of Time?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-are-adam-and-danielle-busby-in-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Are Adam and Danielle Busby in 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
