You might know this fact even if you haven’t watched the show — that’s just how maddening it was for many Sopranos fans. Basically, those fans wanted to definitively know if Tony Soprano (<a href=#>James Gandolfini</a>) died right there in Holsten’s.</p><p id=par-2_57>The way Sopranos creator David Chase saw it, that wasn’t the big question. “If he didn’t die that night, he’s going to die very soon,” Chase told <a href=#>USA Today</a> in 2012. “There are a number of minutes in life […] and [then] they’re gone. And you don’t know when it’s coming. That’s all I wanted to say.”</p><p id=par-3_46>To put it another way: Chase was saying that Tony didn’t reform and die peacefully in bed decades later. With that out of the way, we can focus on a more interesting question: Who ordered the hit on Tony Soprano when his time finally came?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-new-york-mobster-would-most-likely-order-tony-soprano-s-murder-at-the-conclusion-of-the-sopranos>A New York mobster would most likely order Tony Soprano’s murder at the conclusion of ‘The Sopranos’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gandolfini-tony.jpg><p id=par-4_57>At the start of “Made in America,” the Sopranos series finale, Tony and his crew are still at the safe house, where they’d “gone to the mattresses.” The hunt for New York boss Phil Leotardo (<a href=#>Frank Vincent</a>) continues. But Tony needs help, and he starts getting it in a sit-down with Leotardo’s captain, Butch DiConcini (Greg Antonacci).</p><p id=par-5_54>Butchie had antagonized Tony in the past, but at this point in time he agrees his boss Phil went too far. Though he won’t give up Phil’s location, Butchie says his crew won’t retaliate if Tony whacks Phil. Later, Tony gets Phil’s location from FBI agent Harris (<a href=#>Matt Servitto</a>). And he has Phil killed.</p><p id=par-6_55>Phil’s murder ends the war, which had been disastrous for mob business in New York and New Jersey. So at that point, you have to ask: Why would Tony Soprano become a target for a hit right then? In short, the New York families would have been fed up with Tony’s behavior to that point.</p><p id=par-7_57>Tony had antagonized the Lupertazzi family on several occasions in the past; he’d defended the indefensible (Ralph Cifaretto) and backed another banished capo (Vito Spatafore); and, last but not least, he began working with the FBI while another member of his crew became a full-fledged informant. So New York had plenty of reasons to kill Tony.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-theories-about-patsy-parisi-ordering-the-hit-also-deserves-a-mention>Theories about Patsy Parisi ordering the hit also deserves a mention</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sopranos-cemetery.jpg><p id=par-8_46>When discussing the final scene of The Sopranos, many people rightly focus on would-be assassins in Holsten’s. Is it possible the man in the Members Only jacket did the job? Certainly. But why wouldn’t he just walk in and do it? The explanations aren’t entirely satisfying.</p><p id=par-9_62>Anyway, the focus is on who’d order the hit. As far as who had the most to lose with Tony remaining boss, again the answer has to be New York. Tony’s personal disputes halted major construction projects on several occasions. With a friendlier boss who didn’t have an “80-90% chance” of being indicted, New York could make its money with fewer headaches.</p><p id=par-10_41>As for the fringe theories, the idea that the Pontecorvo family set up Tony’s murder doesn’t quite hold water. Eugene killed himself, after all. You’d expect the family to be long gone, living their lives in Florida, trying to forget Jersey.</p><p id=par-11_62>As for <a href=#>Patsy Parisi</a> (Dan Grimaldi) ordering the hit, that theory does have some validity. Patsy himself almost took out Tony in the season 3 premiere, so you know his resentment ran deep. (Tony had Patsy’s brother killed in season 2.) And the last we see them together, Tony was still acting like a jerk toward Patsy. The time was certainly right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMrKapqpGjvLR506ilsmWjpL2zrc2oZLCgkZi4prCMsJ%2BoZZ%2Bnsaa%2BxJ1koaGkY7W1ucto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sergio-p%C3%A9rez-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sergio Prez Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./if-this-california-mansion-sells-for-its-500m-asking-price-it-would-become-america-s-most-expensiv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>If This California Mansion Sells For Its $500M Asking Price, It Would Become America's Most Expensiv</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
