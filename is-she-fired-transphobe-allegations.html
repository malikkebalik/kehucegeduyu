The tweet included a GIF from the 1980 crime-drama film Gloria showing a woman holding handguns in each hand, accompanied by the text “us when we see transphobes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-57-1.png><p>Berry’s tweet quickly gained traction, with many users on Twitter slamming her for allegedly promoting violence against transgender individuals. Some critics went so far as to call for Berry’s dismissal from her position, with the Arizona Freedom Caucus and Senator Anthony Kern demanding her resignation.</p><p>The controversy escalated when Berry made her Twitter account private after making the tweet, leading to further criticism from her detractors.
