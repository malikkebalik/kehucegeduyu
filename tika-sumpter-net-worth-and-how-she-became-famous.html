Here’s a look at Sumpter’s net worth, career, and how she became famous.</p><h2>Tika Sumpter’s movies and TV shows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tika-Sumpter.jpg><p id=par-2_62>Tika Sumpter made her television acting debut in a 2006 episode of the series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, titled “Class.” She then became a cast regular on the daytime drama One Life to Live.

She made her film acting debut in the 2010 movie Stomp the Yard 2: Homecoming, in which she played the character Nikki.</p><p id=par-3_38>In 2011, Sumpter secured a recurring role in the series Gossip Girl. She played Raina Thorpe for 11 episodes. Sumpter’s other acting roles include appearances in Think Like a Man, A Madea Christmas, Ride Along, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Mixed-ish.</p><h2>Tika Sumpter’s highest-grossing films</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tika-Sumpter-Sonic-the-Hedgehog.jpg><p id=par-4_66>As of this writing, Sumpter’s highest-grossing film is Sonic the Hedgehog, with $306.2 million in worldwide earnings.

Here’s what Sumpter told <a href=#>XO Necole</a> about the movie’s message:</p><p>I think the foundational things–that he’s actually into you and loves you and he’s faithful to you, if that’s what your agreement is, and he’s your friend–I think those are things that can’t change. I think those are things you can’t really be flexible on if they’re not in somebody’s spirit. Height, you can be flexible on. Body type, you can be flexible on. I think the outside stuff can be flexible.</p><h2>What’s next for Tika Sumpter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Tika-Sumpter-event.jpg><p id=par-6_80>Sumpter joined forces with Thai Randolph, executive vice president and general manager of Kevin Hart’s organization, Laugh Out Loud Network, to start a new lifestyle brand named <a href=#>Sugaberry</a>. The goal of the website is to provide content and support for mothers of color. “Black women don’t usually get to delight in mommyhood, which is why I wanted to build a safe and sweet destination for modern moms of color, regardless of what stage they are in,” Sumpter told <a href=#>Variety</a>.</p><p id=par-7_45>Sumpter told the publication that Sugaberry is self-funded right now because it gives her greater creative control. “’I feel like it gives us more control over what we want to do without someone saying, ‘This is going to work, this isn’t going to work,’” said the actress.</p><h2>Tika Sumpter’s net worth</h2><p id=par-8_17>As of this writing, Sumpter has a net worth of $6 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> estimates.</p><p id=par-9_11><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=#>Gabrielle Union Net Worth and How She Makes Her Money</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqrfAZqqupaCpsrN5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKVn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-jerma985-age-height-real-name-and-wikipedia-bio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Jerma985?
