In a February 2023 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Challenge Mania,</a> the younger Clark addressed his perceived erasure from the show. Although Kenny wishes he received more air time, the California native admitted he understood.</p><h2><strong>Kenny talks about the few edits he did receive&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=par-6_34>According to the 33-year-old, he’s married and describes himself as a “laid back” person. Therefore, Kenny isn’t flirting with the other contestants and doesn’t start drama, admitting it probably doesn’t make the best TV.</p><p id=par-7_38>Even though he didn’t receive much airtime, the rookie thought he got a good edit when <a href=#>facing Faysal “Fessy” Shafaat</a> in a challenge where the contestants had to push each other off a beam suspended over the water.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_25>Kenny admitted he only lasted a few seconds until falling but noted the edit made it seem like he had a chance for a bit.</p><p id=par-9_41>During the mini-final, the newcomer received one of his lone confessionals, describing the challenge as “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.” Kenny claimed it made him look weak but clarified the comment referred to a knee injury he sustained.</p><h2><strong>Kenny was the first eliminated when the game turned into teams</strong></h2><p id=par-10_49>The San Diego native thought his game was over before it began when he and Kaycee got pulled from the competition series because they tested positive for COVID. However, Emmy Russ and Nam Vo’s <a href=#>choice to quit</a> before the second challenge opened the door for the siblings to return.</p><p id=par-11_37>Due to her connections, they remained safe for most of the competition, only finding themselves up for nomination once when Jay Starrett and Michele Fitzgerald pitted them against her girlfriend Nany González and teammate Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_32>The exes pulled the “safe” dagger and opted to protect the Clarks from elimination. A few weeks later, the game turned into teams, and Kenny found himself on Moriah Jadea’s weaker team.</p><p id=par-13_67>They lost their first challenge, resulting in the younger brother facing rookie sensation Horacio Gutiérrez, who sent him packing. The 33-year-old spent two weeks in quarantine until he returned for another chance to re-enter the competition. However, the two couldn’t beat Fessy and Moriah or Jordan Wiseley and Aneesa Ferreira, ending their game for good a couple of episodes before the final.&nbsp;The Challenge 38&nbsp;airs Wednesdays on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMnJ%2BapJyau6ixjGxvZqOVo7u6ecKlmKujXZaxpb7ErKqeq12jsqK%2By7JkoqamnsCqrsueZJ6cmal7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-deborah-harry-s-net-worth-and-does-she-have-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Deborah Harry's Net Worth and Does She Have Children?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-keyshawn-johnson-make-latest-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Keyshawn Johnson Make?
