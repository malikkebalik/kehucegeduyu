He's devoted a lot of resources to what he's referred to as a "fight" against death itself, and a new book makes public a particularly outlandish investment he made to fight not his own mortality, but to resurrect an entire extinct species – the woolly mammoth.</p><p>The book is called&nbsp;Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Ben Mezrich Net Worth">Ben Mezrich</a>, and according to The Guardian&nbsp;it says Thiel gave $100,000 to&nbsp;Harvard University genomics professor, George Church, in 2015 for the wake-up-Woolly project. Thiel has declined to comment on the investment (no surprise given his secretive inclinations), but Church confirmed it, telling the paper that over a breakfast meeting Thiel told him he was interested in funding "the craziest thing" Church was working on. Church gave him three options: Research into gene therapy treatments to battle aging, an experiment to build an artificial intelligence system using human neurons, or bringing the woolly mammoth back to life using DNA extracted from frozen dead mammoths, and to genetically modify cells of a living elephant. For some reason, he chose the mammoth experiment, and wrote Church a check for $100,000.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-227806 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-619458254.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-227806 class=wp-caption-text>Alex Wong/Getty Images</p><p>If you follow Thiel's activities at all, the fact that he invested $100,000 to bring back an extinct animal isn't too shocking. That same year he told&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;his general philosophy towards death:</p><p>"I've always had this really strong sense that death was a terrible, terrible thing. Most people end up compartmentalizing, and they are in some weird mode of denial and acceptance about death, but they both have the result of making you very passive. I prefer to fight it."</p><p>Bringing back the woolly mammoth would send a pretty strong signal to the world that death can be defeated, as long as one doesn't go on a&nbsp;Jurassic Park&nbsp;style rampage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfpbK1sdFmq6GhlaF6qrrVnqqtnZRifnF8j2lnZpqinruoedaopqWkqWK6ornMqKuhq12XrqS3jKWgn51f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rip-dale-gribble-death-cause-voice-actor-dead-at-64.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RIP Dale Gribble Death Cause: Voice Actor Dead At 64</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-stayed-at-a-luxury-hotel-in-las-vegas-with-no-casino-or-pool-parties-and-didn-t-miss-them-at-a.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I stayed at a luxury hotel in Las Vegas with no casino or pool parties and didn't miss them at a</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
