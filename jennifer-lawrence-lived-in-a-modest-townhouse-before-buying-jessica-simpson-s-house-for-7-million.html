The star isn’t exactly lacking in luxury these days, but her more down-to-Earth style is also a long way from the flashy Hollywood lifestyle. Before upgrading to her current&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beverly Hills house </a>, Jennifer Lawrence built her career while living in a quaint Santa Monica townhouse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-lawrence-lived-in-a-somewhat-humble-house-during-her-rise-to-fame>Jennifer Lawrence lived in a somewhat humble house during her rise to fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/jennifer-lawrence-house.jpg><p id=par-2_75>Roughly a decade after dropping out of high school at 14, Lawrence was circling a life in Hollywood and waiting for her moment to shine (per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Magazine</a>). After some more minor TV work, including a pilot that didn’t air, she finally had a breakthrough in 2006 with an appearance on the hit show&nbsp;Monk&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>). That same year, Lawrence picked up her first L.A.-area home: a 1,400 square-foot Santa Monica townhouse with very few bells and whistles.</p><p id=par-3_69>Although complete with plenty of privacy, the home wasn’t all that close to the beach and had a straightforward design and layout (as detailed by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lonny</a>). Even though an $879K price tag is expensive in most areas of the country, it’s on the low-brow side for Santa Monica. The two-bed, two-bath townhouse would be Lawrence’s oasis as her career took off only a few years after she made the purchase.</p><p id=par-4_87>Lawrence’s Santa Monica pad was still her residence when she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for an Oscar</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Winter’s Bone, the 2010 thriller that largely put her on the map. But by the time she won an Oscar two years later (for&nbsp;Silver Linings Playbook)&nbsp;and was cast as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katniss Everdeen in&nbsp;The Hunger Games</a>, it was clear her simple Santa Monica days were ending. In 2014, Jennifer Lawrence picked up a Beverly Hills house with four times the living space, though she kept her place in Santa Monica for a couple more years (per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Curbed LA</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-lawrence-s-beverly-hills-house-has-been-celebrity-bait>Jennifer Lawrence’s Beverly Hills house has been celebrity bait</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_75>Jennifer Lawrence’s frank interview style has given us a funny insider’s look at her house in Beverly Hills. At the L.A. premiere of&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Lawrence dished to Extra about the house’s past. “It’s Ellen [DeGeneres’] old house. It was Jessica Simpson’s old house,” she said. “It’s like the neighborhood whore. I was outside and some girl said, ‘I grew up in this house.’ Beat it kid. Everybody’s lived in this house.”</p><p id=par-6_69>Covered with ivy and plant life, the secluded five-bedroom house looks more like a New England cottage than an L.A. mansion (per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House & Home</a>). Instead of a party-friendly backyard, the home has a private lap pool and koi pond to complete the laidback atmosphere. For Lawrence, who lives a frenetic life as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a new parent</a>&nbsp;and a movie superstar, privacy and relaxation seem to be the central themes of the space.</p><p id=par-7_79>But even though a 5,500 square-foot Beverly Hills home isn’t exactly slumming it, it’s still very subdued for a top-shelf Hollywood star. No official numbers are available, but most estimates have Lawrence paying Simpson between $7-$8 million for the property. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Curbed</a>, the average price of a Beverly Hills house around that time was well over $4 million. And in just the last year alone, dozens of Beverly Hills homes have sold for more than $15 million (per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redfin</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lawrence-has-an-eye-popping-place-in-new-york-city>Lawrence has an eye-popping place in New York City</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_74>But even though her main living space is almost quaint for Beverly Hills, the actor and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband, Cooke Maroney</a>, also have an incredible East Coast getaway. In New York City, Jennifer Lawrence sold an East Side penthouse for almost $10 million in 2020, then upgraded to a stunning home in Manhattan’s West Village. From the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NY Post</a>, Lawrence paid close to $22 million for the property in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the city.</p><p id=par-9_79>The four-bedroom townhouse is spacious for New York City and is ideally situated in the heart of Manhattan. Just around the corner in Tribeca, Lawrence also owns a unit in an exclusive building packed with other celebrity owners. Ryan Reynolds, Justin Timberlake, and Jessica Biel are just some of the other stars who have owned units in the same building. When Lawrence isn’t using it, she rents it out for as much as $30,000 a month (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><p id=par-10_48>Lawrence has a nice collection of high-end properties at this point, but the 31-year-old can undoubtedly afford it thanks to her flourishing career. After taking some time off, Lawrence pocketed $25 million in 2021 for her<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">role in&nbsp;Don’t Look&nbsp;Up</a>&nbsp;and has a total net worth of about $160 million.</p><p id=par-11_50>Lawrence recently jumped headlong into producing as well—dramatically increasing her earning potential. She is both star and producer for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Elizabeth Holmes biopic</a>&nbsp;Bad Blood, director Adam McKay’s follow-up to&nbsp;Don’t Look Up. After never serving as a producer before 2022,&nbsp;Bad Blood&nbsp;is one of four different projects Lawrence is currently producing (per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3prrNop2eql2hrri%2BxKeanmWcnsOmsIympp2do6l6tbvWp5%2BoraOaeqOxxaipnmWSqsaqusZmoZ6ro56wonnSoqSpq5%2Bjeqm71KycZm9doratuMiopWegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-trzcinski-showbiz-cheat-sheet-writer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt Trzcinski | Showbiz Cheat Sheet Writer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./herb-dean-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Herb Dean Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
