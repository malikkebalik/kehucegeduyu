But, outside of Veganuary, interest in veganism and plant-based diets have skyrocketed in recent years, and now it seems that it might not just be your health and the environment benefitting from you diet. In fact, recent research suggests <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>veganism might help you get a better nights sleep.</a></p><p>If you're considering a switch to veganism, a recent study from the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine</a> might be the deciding factor. The study found that processed meat and animal-based foods can worsen sleeping conditions like obstructive sleep apnoea, a disorder in which your <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>breathing stops and starts</a> during your sleep. But what products should be avoided to help you drift off, and what can be consumed to help you hit the sack?</p><p>Speaking to Bustle, Phil Lawlor, a sleep expert at mattress company <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dormeo</a>, says:</p>“Fatty foods are harder to digest, so can keep your body too busy to sleep. That means that fatty cuts of meat and high-fat dairy products, such as butter and cheese, can disrupt your sleep — especially if consumed in excess or the three hours before bedtime.”<p>However, it's important to note that a vegan diet will not instantly give you a good night's sleep. In fact, a few studies suggest that vitamin B12, which some vegans can end up lacking in their diets, is needed to keep sleep-wake cycles in sync. B12, which is usually digested through animal products, is needed to help speed up reactions in the body, and deficiency can even cause <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>anaemia and nervous system damage.</a> According to Psychology Today, some sleep studies show <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a correlation between low Vitamin B12 and insomnia</a>. Phil Lawlor says plant-based eaters can simply include breakfast cereals, nutritional yeasts and plant-based milks are often fortified with vitamin B12 to make sure it's in their diet.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>vgajic/Getty</p></figure><p>And, if you aren’t a vegan and still want a good night's sleep, there are some products you could cut down on before bed. Needless to say, avoiding coffee is a good idea, Lawlor says. “Its effect differs by person, but a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>study</a> published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that caffeine taken 6 hours before bedtime has important disruptive effects on sleep.” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Consuming sugar</a> and alcohol before bed can also disrupt sleep.</p><p>Consuming the amino acid Tryptophan can also help you get a good night's sleep, Lawlor says. It can be found in oily fish, poultry and eggs. But for plant-based eaters, there are ways to find it elsewhere in seeds, nuts, soy, and beans, Lawlor explains.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Shutterstock</p></figure><p>Whether you're a meat eater or vegan, having a good <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>sleep hygiene</a> (practices and habits necessary to achieve a good night's sleep) will help improve your restless nights. "Participating in regular exercise, eating and drinking well, creating a suitable sleep environment, allowing yourself to unwind before bed, and sticking to a sleep routine," Lawlor says. "If you don't wake up feeling refreshed or regularly struggle to fall asleep, this is likely a symptom of poor sleep hygiene. It's a good idea to speak to your doctor if you're concerned about poor-quality sleep."</p><p>Get The Very Best Of Bustle/UK</p><p>Sign up for Bustle UK's twice-weekly newsletter, featuring the latest must-watch TV, moving personal stories, and expert advice on the hottest viral buys.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jqCmoqaXYsOms8CnZKGZo2K2rrzAnKtmp55ixrDB0WaqpZ2VpXqiec2ermarpKqxunnSoaawq11nfXZ9kGlnbg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pawn-stars-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pawn Stars Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./criminal-minds-recap-10-17-18-season-14-episode-3-rule-34.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Criminal Minds Recap 10/17/18: Season 14 Episode 3 Rule 34</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
