While he can attribute his fame to his acting talent, Pitt’s personal life has also prompted his popularity. With two high-profile marriages – and divorces – to top Hollywood actresses, Pitt maintains a steady presence on tabloid covers.</p><p id=par-2_47>Marrying Jennifer Aniston in 2000, the two divorced just five years later after a rumored affair between Pitt and his&nbsp;Mr. & Mrs. Smith&nbsp;co-star Jolie.&nbsp;<a href=#>Both Aniston and</a> the Se7en star have achieved monumental wealth before and after their divorce, but who’s got a bigger bank account today?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Brad-Pitt-and-Jennifer-Aniston.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt eschew ‘perfect couple’ image</h2><p id=par-3_40>When Aniston and Pitt tied the knot, they became the golden couple of Hollywood. Constantly being followed by paparazzi, the pair were often seen as an example of an ideal marriage. Yet neither enjoyed being put on that pedestal.</p><p id=par-4_61>“Neither of us wants to be the spokesman for happy marriage, for coupledom,” Pitt told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;in 2004. “I’ll tell you what I despise: this two-becomes-one thing where you lose your individuality. We don’t cage each other with this pressure of happily ever after. You figure it out as you go along. We feel it out, rather than setting policies and rules.”</p><p id=par-5_26>After their breakup, Aniston spoke to Oprah Winfrey and described the ‘perfect image’ of her marriage to Pitt as a facade manufactured by the press.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jennifer-Aniston-and-Brad-Pitt-2.jpg><p id=par-6_61>“It is created so totally by the media,” she told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Winfrey</a>&nbsp;in 2005. “It’s not real. It’s just not real… You’re human beings having a human experience and there’s nothing different except that you’re exposed to the world as a public person. But your personal life, your personal feelings, your heart, your success, your pain, your everything, is the same as anybody else’s.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Aniston focuses on film after ‘Friends’</h2><p id=par-7_43>Rising to fame as Rachel Green on the iconic sitcom Friends, Aniston soon became one of the most sought-after actresses in show business. Now with over 40 film credits to her name, the Along Came Polly star is considered box office gold.</p><p id=par-8_44>Deciding to pivot into producing, Aniston serves as executive producer and star of the Apple TV+ series&nbsp;The Morning Show along with Reese Witherspoon. The former Friends star earned a producer credit on several other projects including&nbsp;Dumplin’, Murder Mystery, and&nbsp;The Yellow Birds, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>IMDb</a>.</p><p id=par-9_57>The actress now gives herself the freedom to be more choosy when it comes to picking roles. “Time is precious, and what takes me away from home has to be really worth it,” Aniston told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2019. “In the last 10 years, I’m just having more fun and exploring characters I wouldn’t have normally thought to do.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_8><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Celebrity net worth</a> lists Aniston at $300 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brad Pitt’s impressive resume</h2><p id=par-11_66>When Pitt hit the big screen in the 1991 film&nbsp;Thelma & Louise, he quickly became a household name. Taking the lead on numerous films including Legends of the Fall, Troy, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, the Academy Award winner began developing other interests. Pitt created his own production company Plan B to take on projects behind the camera and is also active in philanthropy.</p><p id=par-12_44>Now co-parenting his six kids with Jolie, Pitt is focused on his sobriety and choosing authentic roles. With a nonstop film career and two marriages splashed across the tabloids, the Moneyball star has developed a healthy perspective on being such a popular media topic.</p><p id=par-13_72>“When I first started my career, I was in USA Today. I was pretty pleased with myself,” the Fight Club actor told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The New York Time</a>.&nbsp;“Two days after it came out, I go over to a friend-of-a-friend’s house. In the kitchen I look down and there’s a litter box for the cat — and there’s my piece in USA Today with a cat turd on top of it. That pretty much defines it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_20>With&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;listing his total also at $300 million, it looks like Pitt and Aniston still have something in common.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs63DZqeirKRirq%2BwjKOcp6aZm7KzecCnoKysn6N6uLTOZp%2Baq12ptaZ5x6KeoZ2iYrumwIywpqusmGO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-gilmore-girls-characters-who-inexplicably-disappeared-but-we-wish-they-hadn-t.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 'Gilmore Girls' Characters Who Inexplicably Disappeared, but We Wish They Hadn't</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-randy-houska-chelsea-houska-s-dad-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Randy Houska, Chelsea Houska's Dad, Today?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
