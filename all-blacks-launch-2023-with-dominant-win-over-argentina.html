It was a closer second half by all means but there will be plenty that the visitors will be happy with today against a strong Pumas outfit on paper.</p><p>The scrum was utterly dominant and players given a chance to push their cases - Josh Lord, Emoni Narawa and Damian McKenzie especially come to mind - made good on Foster's "vote of confidence" in them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>That's all for us on the live updates.

Set piece perfection as the wrap around puts McKenzie in space and he links up with Beauden Barrett who finishes in the left corner.

They look to launch a counterattack with it but get ahead of themselves and there's a knock on - All Blacks scrum 35m from the Los Pumas line.</p><p><b>54min: ARG 5-31 NZL</b></p><p>All Blacks are straight back on the attack. They go deep on the restart, Argentina look to clear but it is a truly horrible kick. All Blacks with a lineout just 10m from the Los Pumas line.</p><p><b>53min: ARG 5-31 NZL</b></p><p><b>ARG TRY! </b>Quick tap leads to the try! Argentina go close on two attempts before Sordoni finally powers over the line.</p><p><b>51min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>SIGNS OF LIFE FROM LOS PUMAS! Bruni back on the pitch and makes a break. He's finally brought down short of the All Blacks' line. The All Blacks scramble back but give up an advantage stopping the play. Argentina can't find it and so we come back for the penalty.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><b>48min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>Argentina string some phases together but are caught napping as the All Blacks pull off a turnover at their ruck through who else but Savea! It's settled by NZ and McKenzie clears impressively - Argentina lineout 5m inside their half.</p><p><b>47min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>The first big chance of the half for NZ goes begging as Scott Barrett is penalised at an All Blacks ruck for a neck roll. To make matters worse, he's then penalised soon after again - this time for a side entry at a ruck. So that's 80m on the trot and suddenly Los Pumas are on the attack thanks to the All Blacks No.4.</p><p><b>44min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>And another scrum penalty worked by de Groot and Lomax! They are on another level today! McKenzie kicks for touch and it's a lineout 10m from the Los Pumas line!</p><p><b>43min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Strong run from Matera gives Argentina something to work with but as quickly as the attack starts, it's over with a knock on. All Blacks scrum 10m inside their half.</p><p><b>41min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>Argentina under a tonne of pressure from the deep kick. They clear but don't find touch and Clarke brings it back. Ball comes to the middle of the field and Cane rumbles inside the Argentinian 22. Another quick ball but McKenzie can't control it on a wrap around attempt and there's a knock on. Los Pumas scrum just outside their 22.</p><p><b>40min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>Back underway in Mendoza with a McKenzie kickoff! A reminder - <b>Argentina only have 14 men for the first 10 minutes </b>after Bruni's yellow card to finish the first 40 minutes.</p><p>Of note - Argentina took a long time to come out of the sheds here. All Blacks also playing with the setting sun in their eyes now. Let's see if it makes a difference!</p><p><b>HT: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So that wraps up the first half of action here in Mendoza and after a shaky first minute, it's been all one-way traffic in favour of the All Blacks.</p><p>Put simply, they've looked the more prepared with the better gameplan and they have punished the Pumas with it. Confidence has grown throughout the side as the game has progressed and that's allowed the All Blacks to play some of that footy that Richie Mo'unga said earlier this week was in their "DNA". Narawa looks good on debut, Barrett and McKenzie look fine at 15 and 10 but the real standouts so far have been Ioane in the midfield, de Groot's scrummaging and Josh Lord making the most of his start at the lineouts.</p><p>Stay with us, we'll have the second half shortly.</p><p><b>40min: ARG 0-31 NZL</b></p><p><b>NZL TRY! ARG YELLOW! </b>The update says it all! A brutal blow to Argentina as the All Blacks add another on halftime. They win their own lineout, set the maul and get the penalty advantage. With that in mind, Smith takes it off the back, sells a big dummy to his right and goes in to score himself. Gardner has had enough though and sends Bruni to the bin for entering the maul on the side previously. A brilliant finish to a strong half from the All Blacks but the Pumas will be hurting... a lot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvnz-1-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/EKLIDFPGSRHLJEHR334OMOVN6Y.jpg><p><b>38min: ARG 0-24 NZL</b></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ANOTHER penalty at the breakdown against Argentina and Gardner has a chat with Montoya. Says enough is enough. All Blacks now with a lineout 5m from the line. Can they strike again before the half?</p><p><b>36min: ARG 0-24 NZL</b></p><p>What is going on with Argentina?! After getting penalised and being put on the backfoot again, a superb turnover from Bruni gives them some ball and not only do they kick it away again - they kick it out on the full! And it's not even close, this ball has sailed into the Mendoza stands. Back we come for an All Blacks lineout 35m from the Argentinian line.</p><p>Rattled might be an understatement... halftime can't come soon enough for Los Pumas.</p><p><b>35min: ARG 0-24 NZL</b></p><p>The All Blacks scrum creates <u>another</u> penalty but a knock on shortly after the ensuing lineout ends their latest attacking chance.

After a couple of resets, Argentina get the ball away to the right.

Perfect height, flying in with shoulder and arms wrapped. Textbook.</p><p><b>31min: ARG 0-24 NZL</b></p><p>Argentina go deep on the restart. Barrett clears and there's a double knock-on in the chase. NZ made the first error though so it's a Los Pumas scrum just outside the All Blacks' 22 and near the right sideline - good attacking chance here for the hosts.</p><p><b>30min: ARG 0-24 NZL</b></p><p><b>NZL TRY! </b>Ioane is in! Strong scrum gives them the platform and with the ball coming to the right, Ioane makes a step inside his first tackler to shake him off, brushes off a second one and finds the chalk. All Blacks well and truly on top in Mendoza!</p><p><b>28min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>The All Blacks go to the right looking for another hole in the midfield but can't find it. McKenzie opts for a cheeky crossfield kick to Beauden Barrett on the left wing, finds him and Barrett tries to link up with Clarke. He does so, there's one to beat and Clarke tries to get the offload away but it's knocked on by a wayward arm from an Argentinian tackler. Not deliberate as he was going for the tackle so it's an All Blacks scrum 5m from the line near the left sideline.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><b>26min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>All Blacks are right back on the attack after a pair of penalties.

All Blacks make the error at their lineout and Argentina string together some strong phases! The forwards rumble them inside the All Blacks' 22 before it's fired out to the left wing. Narawa has to get across for the tackle and with help from Barrett, bundle the ball into touch as Carreras goes for the line. Great defence.</p><p><b>22min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>Scrum penalty for the All Blacks! Argentina went for the shove but skewer it doing so so the All Blacks get their exit.

The ball is recycled quickly to the forwards but Lomax with a big hit on his tryline forces the knock on! All Blacks survive this one but they're not out of jail yet - scrum on their 5m line.</p><p><b>19min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>Argentina get their first real chance as Cane is penalised for a cleanout off the ball. There's certainly three points on offer but they know if they want to make history, threes won't cut it so to the corner we go and it's an Argentinian lineout 10m from the All Blacks' line.</p><p><b>16min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>First real error from the All Blacks and a pass sails into touch. Argentina get a lineout and despite Lord's best efforts to steal it, he knocks it on so Los Pumas with a scrum this time, 10m from halfway.</p><p><b>15min: ARG 0-17 NZL</b></p><p>Argentina go short this time on the restart and get a hand to the ball but can't control it.

The Pumas and the All Blacks squads are likely to evolve over that period.</p><p>Both lineups contain elements of experimentation as coaches work out their most effective combinations.</p><p>Damian McKenzie will start at flyhalf for New Zealand for the third time in his 41st test as All Blacks coach Ian Foster examines his options at No. 10 and possible playmaker combinations. Beauden Barrett is at fullback and Richie Mo’unga is on the bench.</p><p>“We have clearly got Beauden at fullback and Richie at 10 so we have a bit of a luxury there at the moment,” Foster said. “It’s just a nice vote of confidence in Damian.</p><p>“When you have been out of the All Blacks for a while there is always a bit of nerves and I think this is a great way for him to come in and hopefully play from a position of strength.”</p><p>McKenzie played in Japan last year in a move which could have ended his international career. But he has won over Foster as probably the most consistent New Zealand playmaker of the season in Super Rugby.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Argentina has recalled tighthead prop Lucio Sardoni, who played his most recent test in 2020 and since then has been regularly sidelined by injuries. There are five changes to the Argentine team from its last test, a loss in Scotland in November.</p><p>Emiliano Boffelli will start at fullback, having played every test since Australian Michael Cheika took over as head coach. Julias Montoya will captain the Pumas from hooker with the veteran Agustin Creevy is on the bench.</p><p>Last year, the Pumas beat New Zealand away, Australia at home and England away after opening their season with a series win at home against Scotland.</p><p>This week, Cheika has been concentrating on one thing after players returned from clubs in Europe.</p><p>“It really focusses, sharpens the mind when you have to play New Zealand first up,” he said.
