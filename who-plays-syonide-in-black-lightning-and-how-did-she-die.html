Dean made her first appearance as Syonide in the pilot episode of Black Lightning and returned for a total of nine episodes before being killed off in the season two premiere.</p><p>This year at Cannes, the actress shared her role with co-star <a href=# rel=noopener>Woody Harrelson</a> for their work in the film Triangle of Sadness which was released in theatres on October 7, 2022.

The South African actress was well-known for more than just her role in Black Lightning; she also modeled and starred in a number of films such as Spud, Don’t Sleep, Blood in the Water and most recently, Triangle of Sadness, opposite Woody Harrelson.</p><p><strong>You can read about these latest topics also:</strong></p><h2><strong>What was the Reason of Charlbi Dean Kriek’ Death?</strong></h2><p>Dean had been dating fellow South African actor and model <a href=# rel=noopener>Luke Volker</a> since 2018 and they were engaged at the time of her death.<strong> As of the 29th of August 2022, Dean was hospitalized in New York City due to illness. </strong>Despite having relatively mild symptoms at first her condition deteriorated rapidly and she passed away a few hours later at the age of 32.</p><p>On 21 December 2022, autopsy results revealed that the <strong>actress had died from bacterial sepsis, brought on by an infection called capnocytophaga.</strong> Since her spleen had to be removed after her car accident in 2008, she was at a much higher risk of developing life-threatening infections.
