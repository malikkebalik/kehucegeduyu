I mean, I still don’t dislike her, but she’s playing the game a little obviously now, you know? A little goes a long way, and it’s a fine line between “oh it’s nice to see her” and “how many times do we have to see her?” I want to be surprised a little and this is kind of predictable.</p><p>Anyway Hayden and Wladimir Klitschko were seen on the beach in Miami embracing and looking couple-y. (You can <a href=#>see those photos here</a>, they’re exclusives so we don’t have them today, sorry!) She wasn’t wearing what could be her engagement ring, she had that on her right hand during her previous bikini photo op. A lot of outlets, along with you guys, pointed out that she has obvious breast implants. I kind of thought that was a given, and earlier in the week I was more tolerant and benevolent towards Hayden so I didn’t mention it. They are wonky, but I’m flat like Hayden was before and I would get some if I worked in Hollywood. I mean I’m still thinking about getting some so I can’t fault her for that.</p><p>In a new cover story and interview in Glamour, Hayden skirts around the fact that she was on-off with Wladimir, and claims that they were friends for five years and she always stays friendly with her exes. She also sort-of confirms her engagement, and says that she’s super ready to be a mom:</p><p><strong>Rumor has it you’re back together with Wladimir Klitschko?</strong> [Huge smile.] I think it’s pretty obvious. I’m not going to deny it.</p><p><strong>How does a girl from New York transplanted to Nashville meet a Ukrainian boxer?</strong> [Laughs.] Life is like a lunchroom at school. In this industry you’ve got little individual tables of actors, singers, rap stars, this, that, the other. But it’s a big industry that also encompasses anyone in the public eye. An acquaintance of ours did a coffee-table book, and the proceeds went to genocide prevention. We met at the party for the launch of the book; we’ve been friends for five years—we’ve never not been close.</p><p><strong>So what’s different this time?</strong> It’s like the 2.0 version. I’ve always had great relationships and stayed really good friends with the guys I’ve dated. It blows my mind sometimes that us getting together has gotten so much attention. It’s like, Really? This is breaking news?</p><p><strong>How would you say your parents have affected your relationships?</strong> They split up when I was 18. There was this whole thing, and my dad went to jail. [In 2008 her father was arrested for allegedly striking her mother in the face.] When it happened, I knew my denying it or saying it was false wasn’t going to do anything. People would just say, “Oh, she’s in denial.” My parents are really good people—they just are not meant to be together.</p><p><strong>It seems that everyone in Hollywood is getting married younger and younger these days. What’s the timing going to be for you?</strong> I don’t really have a plan. I’ve lived a very big life, and I don’t feel my age, and I feel like I was born to be a mother. Sometimes people speak about [having kids] like, “Your life ends—you’re never going to be able to do anything again!” And I’m like, “What are you talking about?” Motherhood is the most beautiful, exciting thing, and there’s nothing that I feel like I can’t accomplish while having children in my life. I would sacrifice having more years of being wherever I want whenever I want for years with my kids.</p><p><strong>Could you be with the father of your children now?</strong> It wouldn’t shock me!</p><p>Read the complete interview with Hayden Panettiere in the May issue of Glamour, on newsstands April 9.</p><p><a href=#>[From US Magazine]</a></p><p>This begs the question: is she pregnant now? Is that why Wlad proposed (allegedly)? She does have a tiny little belly in the beach photos, but it could be a nice lunch since she’s so fit and anything would show on her frame. She talked a lot in that interview about how she feels older than she is, 23, and I would bet that she’s cluing us in to a pregnancy. Well if she is pregnant, she’ll probably be papped plenty of times and we’ll learn about it shortly. I’m wondering if they’ll work her pregnancy in to Nashville’s second season. (IF she’s pregnant.) It would be a good plot twist!</p><p>There’s a new episode of “Nashville” coming tonight. Wiki says we have <a href=#>five more episodes</a> until the end of the season. I love that, because so many of my shows are wrapping up now.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/haydenglamourcover.jpg alt title=haydenglamourcover width=500 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/haydenglamour2.jpg alt title=haydenglamour2 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/haydenglamour3.jpg alt title=haydenglamour3 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_Panettiere_Hayden_MISB_033113_51054260-1-838x1024.jpg alt title=FFN_Panettiere_Hayden_MISB_033113_51054260-(1) width=500 sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos credit: Peggy Sirota for Glamour and FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3Bpa312e8easJ2dnpS9orrErauinaKarKqrxZ6cpZecnrimq8iYrpqrj5e8s7q%2BraaYmpWUrqC5zq2fnqqPnsCgv8eelqmqlZy7orrTmGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-cowboys-star-micah-parsons-dating-travis-kelce-s-ex-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Cowboys Star Micah Parsons Dating Travis Kelce's Ex-Girlfriend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ari-sandel-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ari Sandel Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-real-life-couples-who-broke-up-while-on-the-show.html>3 Real-Life Couples Who Broke up While on the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./does-moonfall-have-a-post-credits-scene.html>Does Moonfall have a post-credits scene?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./hire-nicolas-cage-for-an-appearance-at-events-or-keynote-speaker-bookings.html>Hire Nicolas Cage For an Appearance at Events or Keynote Speaker Bookings.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./juice-wrld-net-worth-his-last-words-all-songs-current-date-format-f-y.html>Juice Wrld Net Worth, His Last Words &amp;amp; All Songs [current_date format='F Y']</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-spalding-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>Kim Spalding Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
