She alleged that he had sent her inappropriate texts that were "sexual in nature", had touched her back in an "unwanted and sustained" manner at an awards show, had held a mirror above her shower cubicle while she was showering, and had danced naked in front of her in their dressing room.</p><p>In 2012, Stone married Australian actor <a href=#>Dan Spielman</a>, with whom she lived in New York City. In July 2017, Stone announced that her marriage had ended over a year before. Stone is an atheist. Stone is currently dating AIME Mentoring founder <a href=#>Jack Manning</a> Bancroft. On 23 November 2017, it was announced they were expecting their first child. On 30 May 2018, they welcomed a baby girl, Pemau Stone Bancroft.</p><p>Stone moved to New York permanently in December 2011 and co-founded an experimental theatre company. After four months in New York, she was cast in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, a show set in a women's prison. Stone plays Lorna Morello, a prisoner from New Jersey; her accent, a mixture of Brooklyn and Boston, was called "the most amazing accent on television" by a journalist for The New Republic, while another reviewer deemed the role to be Stone's "breakout turn". She reprised her role in the show's second season, and was billed as a series regular in the third season.</p><p>Stone began acting as a child, with roles in the film Me Myself I and the miniseries The Farm. She worked primarily in theatre; at the 2008 Sydney Theatre Awards, she won the awards for Best Newcomer and Best Supporting Actress for her performance in The Kid. She also worked in television, including supporting roles in All Saints and Spirited. From 2010 to 2011, she appeared in The Diary of a Madman (a theatrical adaptation of the Gogol short story), a role for which she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Sydney Theatre Awards. In February 2011, she travelled to New York City to perform in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's production of The Diary of a Madman, before returning to lead roles in A Golem Story, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll, and As You Like It in Sydney.</p><p>Yael Stone (born 6 March 1985) is an Australian actress. She has worked extensively in Australian theatre and has won two Sydney Theatre Awards. Outside of Australian theatre, she is best known for her portrayal of Lorna Morello in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black.
