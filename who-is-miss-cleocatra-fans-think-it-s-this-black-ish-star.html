The night opens with panelists Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, Rita Ora, and Robin Thicke putting on a performance of the Spice Girls’ anthem “Wannabe.” Ora and Thicke command the stage with their incredible performances while Jeong and McCarthy-Wahlberg add comic relief. The panelists are bathed in pink and purple light to celebrate feminity.</p><p id=par-4_36>Miss Cleocatra, Beets, Gumball, and the wild card, Seal, performant on “Girl Group Night.” Fans saw Miss Cleocatra take the stage on “The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;Night,” and that’s also where her first clue package was revealed.</p><p id=par-5_74>“Are you a good witch or a bad witch? It’s taken me some time to figure that out,” Miss Cleocatra says in her clue package&nbsp;while motioning to an hourglass. “Long ago, I was living life in technicolor.
