Diamond is most famous for playing Screech on Saved By the Bell. His role over 13 seasons of various Saved <a href=#>TV series</a> ensures the show will be his legacy. However, Dustin Diamond had a career over 30 years. Paul Reubens shared a post on his official Pee-Wee Herman <a href=#>Instagram</a> remembering Diamond and the movie they made together.</p><h2 id=h-dustin-diamond-was-in-a-pee-wee-herman-movie-before-saved-by-the-bell>Dustin Diamond was in a Pee-Wee Herman movie before ‘Saved By the Bell’</h2><p id=par-2_50>Diamond was a child actor from the age of 10. He was 11 when he joined the cast of Good Morning, Miss Bliss, the series that became Saved By the Bell. When He was 10, Diamond appeared in Big Top Pee-Wee, the second Pee-Wee Herman movie after Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saved-By-the-Bell-star-Dustin-Diamond-1.jpg><p id=par-3_33>In this movie, Pee-Wee is a farmer.

The Pee-Wee Herman performer remembered he had some competition for making the crew laugh.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pee-Wee-Herman.jpg><p id=par-5_81>“I just saw the news that actor Dustin Diamond, best known as Screech from Saved by the Bell, passed away,” Reubens wrote. “Dustin acted in my movie Big Top Pee-wee when he was ten years old. It was his first featured role in a movie. I first met him at his audition. Even as a kid, he was charming as well as talented. I remember he had a very gentle spirit. He was very funny and loved to make people laugh.”</p><p id=par-6_24>Diamond only received his cancer diagnosis three weeks prior to his death. Reubens had heard the news and took the opportunity to reach out.&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhere, I saw an address to write him and did just that. I wanted him to know that I vividly remembered working with him all those years ago and he had stuck in my mind because he was so professional, happy and creative. And, that I thought his performance in the movie was wonderful. I told him I was joining with the tens of thousands of others who were wishing him well, praying for him and holding him in our thoughts. At the end of my note, I said for him to please get well and when he did, we¹d catch up on the last thirty years.&nbsp;</p>Paul Reubens, Pee-wee Herman official Instagram, 2/1/21<p id=par-7_11>Unfortunately, he may never know if he reached Diamond in time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dustin-Diamond-age-11.jpg><p id=par-8_34>“I don¹t know if he saw my note or someone read it to him, but I hope so,” Reubens wrote. “Rest In Peace, Dustin.
